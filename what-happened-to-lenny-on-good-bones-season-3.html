Laine and Mina Starsiak Hawk are the ultimate mom-daughter team.</p><p>With the hilarious, creative, and super hardworking duo, there’s never a dull moment on the hit HGTV show. But, other than these two, contractor Lenny who was featured in the early seasons, quickly became a favorite.</p><p>It’s no wonder fans were left wondering just what became of him when he no longer appeared in subsequent seasons.</p><p>Here’s what we know about what happened to Lenny on Good Bones.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where’s Lenny From Good Bones?</h2><p>While Mina and Karen are undoubtedly the stars of the show, on Good Bones Lenny was the creative brains behind the home reno projects, at least on the first two seasons of the show. He literally gave life to ‘dead houses,’ and that was definitely an impressive feat.</p><p>Despite his outstanding performance and pivotal role, Lenny disappeared from the show just like that. We never saw him the entire of season 3 and all our hopes of him ever returning were dashed when there still wasn’t any sighting of the handy contractor and his team when season 4 premiered May 14, 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Lenny on Good Bones: It Runs In the Family</h2><p>Apart from the amazing work the cast does to give a new lease of life to homes, what makes Good Bones even more interesting is the fact that it is a family affair. That’s right! The main cast members are related to each other in some way or another and you guessed right, Lenny is part of the family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">“Good Bones”‘ Family Tree explained</figure><p>If all this is news to you, let’s get you caught up first. So, before divorcing him, Karen was married to Casey, an orthopedic surgeon with whom they had three children, including Mina. After their divorce, Casey went on to marry a lady by the name Cheryl with whom they had two children, Tad and Jess. This makes Tad, who plays a leading role in the show, Mina’s stepbrother.</p><p>So, where’s Lenny in all of this? Well, remember Cheryl? Before she married Casey, she had married and later divorced a guy called Lenny. Later, Cheryl divorced Casey and remarried Lenny before her untimely death. If you are wondering if that makes Lenny Tad’s step-dad, you’d be absolutely right!</p><p>And that’s the story of how Lenny became part of the family and went on to get involved with Mina and Karen’s <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title="home renovation" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>home renovation</a> company, Two Chicks and a Hammer and, subsequently, the HGTV hit Good Bones.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">The Truth about “Good Bones”</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why’s Lenny Not on Good Bones Season 3?</h2><p>When season 3 returned, no one on the show spoke about Lenny and his whereabouts. With no mention of his absence, fans were basically left to speculate all they could about what happened to the contractor. Did Lenny and the mother-daughter duo part ways because of a bitter feud? It doesn’t seem like it.</p><p>Word on the street has it that even though Lenny is family, Mina and Karen had to let him and his team go as his services had become too expensive.</p><p>Since the start of the show, the two have always insisted on showing viewers that it is possible to do spectacular home upgrades within a reasonable budget.</p><p>It seems like when it became obvious that keeping Lenny’s contracting company on would go contrary to their mission of cost-effectiveness, the mother-daughter team had to look elsewhere for a more affordable contractor.</p><p>Even though fans would love to have Lenny back on the show, for now, we’re just glad that HGTV will be renewing one of our favorite ‘fixer’ shows for a fifth season!</p><p>Update:<br>Karen&nbsp;has retired from “Two Chicks and a Hammer,” but remains a regular on the show. We are beyond excited and wish her all the best!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnLnqWnsV2ku26zzqibZpqfo7K0edKemKynnmKAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
