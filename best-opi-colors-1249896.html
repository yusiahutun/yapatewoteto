But, you don't have to worry as we are here with our detailed buying guide that will help you find your ideal match. Here are some factors that you must carefully consider when you go shopping for the top OPI colors:</p><p><strong>Skin Tones&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Consider your skin tone first since it plays a huge role in deciding which shades will suit you the best. Fair skin tones, for instance, must opt for pastels, pinks, and light neutrals while darker skin tones look the best with deep and bright shades of reds, oranges, neons, and brown nudes. Olive or medium skin tones can pull off any color from coral and blue to green and brown shades. Shades like creamy whites and hot pink are universally flattering.</p><p><strong>Undertones</strong></p><p>You must consider your skin undertones, whether you have warm, cool, or neutral undertones. While warm undertones pair well with oranges and reds, colors like purple and pink are more suited for cool undertones. Nail polish colors with a blue undertone complement cool undertones and the ones with a red or orange undertone complement warm undertones.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>OPI is free of 9 harsh and harmful ingredients, including formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin, toluene, xylene, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), camphor, parabens, ethyl tosylamide, and triphenyl phosphate. But that should not stop you from checking the product label. Ensure that there are no ingredients in the nail polish of our choice that can cause any allergy or irritation.</p><p><strong>Finish</strong></p><p>Matte, shimmery, glossy, glittery, and sheer—OPI nail polishes come in varying finishes just as they come in varying colors. Pick the one that fits your preferences and the occasion where you will be wearing the nail polish.</p><p><strong>Pigmentation and Color Payoff</strong></p><p>Pick colors that are intensely pigmented and offer a good color payoff. This will ensure that your nail polish color looks vibrant and you don't have to apply multiple layers to get the desired color.</p><p><strong>Other Features</strong></p><p>Look for a long-lasting and chip-resistant formula so that you don't have to keep coming back to fix your manicure every few days. OPI nail polishes are known for their longevity and chip resistance, so you don't have to worry about this aspect.</p><p><strong>Occasion and Season</strong></p><p>Things like occasion and season must be considered too. For instance, neutral shades and soft pastels are ideal for daily wear to the office or a formal lunch, while brighter reds and dramatic greens are best for brunch with friends, date night, or a party.</p><p>Similarly, bright and bold colors are more suited for the summer season, while deep earthy tones go well in fall and winter.</p><p><strong>Outfit&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Since you usually coordinate your nail polish with your outfits, consider the colors that complement the colors and vibes of your clothes the most. You can also pick neutral colors like beige, nude, and brown as they are versatile and can go with any outfit.</p><p><strong>Read Reviews</strong></p><p>Make sure to read customer reviews and feedback on various online platforms and nail blogs to gain a better understanding of the real-life efficacy and performance of the OPI colors of your choice.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Apply OPI Nail Polish?</h2></p><p>Applying the OPI nail polish requires no rocket science. However, there are ways through which you can extend the life and vibrancy of your manicure. So here's a step-by-step guide on how to apply OPI nail polish for optimal results:</p><ul><li>Start with clean and dry hands. You must remove the existing nail polish using an acetone-free nail polish remover if you are wearing any.</li><li>Trim your nails to the desired length and using a nail file, shape them away to achieve your desired nail shape.</li><li>&nbsp;Be gentle with your cuticles. You don't have to remove them. Gently pushing them back will also do the trick.</li><li>Create a smooth nail surface by gently buffing out your nails.</li><li>If you will use a UV or LED lamp, don't forget to wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30.</li><li>Apply a thin and even layer of base coat to each nail. This helps your nail polish to adhere better and prevents your nails from yellowing.</li><li>Once the base coat has dried completely, start applying a thin and even layer of the OPI nail polish color.</li><li>Shake it well before use so that the color is evenly mixed.&nbsp;</li><li>When it comes to application, start at the base and take the brush up and then to the sides.</li><li>Apply a second or a third layer only if it is necessary, and only when the first coat has dried completely.&nbsp;</li><li>Finish off with a thin layer of top coat to seal in all the layers of color below. This ensures that your nail polish stays on for a long time without fading, chipping, or losing its vibrancy.</li><li>Let your nails air dry. If you are using <a href=#>gel nail polish</a> or gel top coat, cure it under the UV lamp according to the duration specified in the instructions.</li></ul><p>And that's it! You did it!</p><p>Everyone loves a good ol' vibrant manicure that can make the whole place shimmer.
