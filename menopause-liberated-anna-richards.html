I knew lots of the symptoms to expect, but deep down I was not ready to accept those early changes that began materialising in my mid-40s.</p><p id=ezbn1tQD8Q6 data-wc=91>Looking back, I can see I was quietly trying to convince myself that I was still too young to be menopausal. The changes were subtle at first. Hot flushes became more frequent and often happened at night, so I could sometimes blame it on a little more wine at dinner maybe, but for the first time in my life I realised that good sleep was not something I could take for granted. My sleep pattern was impacted and unlikely to return to the way it was, and I immediately missed it.</p><p id=e3bBNGmQlHf data-wc=46>Randomly throughout the day, I would suddenly feel hot and my skin was sweaty for no reason. Thankfully migraines were few and far between, but I realised they were also part of my body’s changes and I had to hope they would not be too frequent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b538e3b03958-anna-richards.jpg><p id=eeRr_D9Buj4 data-wc=62>My biggest concern was the effect these hormonal changes would have on my ability to function with confidence and clarity. For most of the time I was fine, ready to take on the world, but I wasn’t ready for the days when I just lost it. My confidence was low and I felt I had no ability to deal with day-to-day issues.</p><p id=ewLvzf7P_U4t data-wc=66>This wasn’t me, but an imposter who was struggling to deal with basics for no reason. Also why did I have to deal with the menopause? I was excited for my next career chapter, having just launched my ethical porn site <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Frolicme.com</a>, created to provide a safe place for women and couples to explore and enjoy healthy sexuality and learn the benefits that sex can bring.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm a menopause wellness coach and this is what helped me through menopause" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7e9cf848cfd8-8592-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm a menopause wellness coach and this is what helped me through menopause" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm a menopause wellness coach and this is what helped me through menopause</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eeQtGc-fKu9i data-wc=37>At the time my girlfriends were opening up about their own perimenopausal challenges.
