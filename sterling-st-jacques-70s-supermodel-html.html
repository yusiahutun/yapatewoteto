He moved to LA for college in his late teens and became a go-go dancer while there.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May 1972, the budding actor - then claiming to be 22 years old - made headlines when four men attempted to rob a Bel Air home he had been occupying at the time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the property belonged to Raymond St. Jacques, not Sterling.
