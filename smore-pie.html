And then I never told you about them, because I forgot to take pictures of the finished product. Really! I never meant to go this long.

I brought this to this year’s* barbecue, sadly Marine-free, the same one where <a href=#>my friend Molly made her killer ribs</a>. It was gone in 60 seconds. It was declared the best thing I’ve ever made. In short: people go ape schizz over s’mores.</p><p><a title="chocolate layer" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2113/2538806239_b68ed18a1d_n.jpg alt="chocolate layer" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="would like to swan dive in" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3247/2538815737_a09e557893_n.jpg alt="would like to swan dive in" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>That said, I had my doubts going into this recipe, which had been featured (oddly enough, as I consider s’mores a summer thing) in a Thanksgiving issue of Gourmet. I expected cloying sweetness, a gooey, hard to slice pie and a flavor that didn’t match the burnt-edged marshmallow, puddle of chocolate and graham cracker crunch of my summer camp memories, but I made it anyway because even an average attempt at s’more-y goodness is never a bad thing.</p><p><a title="bubbling sugar for marshmallows" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/2539646636_ae916d57eb_n.jpg alt="bubbling sugar for marshmallows" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="marshmallows are messy!" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2117/2539661784_01b27ab4e4_n.jpg alt="marshmallows are messy!" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I was dead wrong on each concern. This was <i>better</i> than real s’mores, in a grown up and awesome way. I’d skipped the salt and used salted butter in the graham cracker crust, which was a toasty and delicious contrast to the sugary topping. The chocolate layer was bittersweet, thanks to the 70 percent we used (though you could use milk chocolate if you wanted a more classic flavor). And though the marshmallow layer was indeed as sweet as you’d expect marshmallows to be, it was held in check by the other two layer’s barely-there sweetness.</p><p>And then I forgot to take pictures of a serving the gooey final product again because we were too busy eating it. But this time, I’m not waiting a year to get you all caught up. I don’t want to cause mutiny on the smittenkitchen bounty.</p><p><a title="the last known picture of the pie" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2122/2544952671_5b78652c3c.jpg alt="the last known picture of the pie" width=500 height=335 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>* <b>Navel-Gazing Aside:</b> One of the funniest things about cataloging my kitchen endeavors is seeing how cyclical my cooking inclinations are. Without realizing it before now, I have made a <a href=#>graham</a> <a href=#>cracker</a> <a href=#>dessert</a> every May for the last three years–and not any other month–and now I realize that I brought the same dessert–s’mores–to two Memorial Day barbecues in a row (with a <a href=#>Strawberry-Rhubarb</a> <a href=#>dessert</a> in the days before). Wait, this interests nobody but me? Shocking!</p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Zucchini Carpaccio Salad</a></p><p><b>Smore Pie</b><br>Adapted from Gourmet, November 2006</p><p>Don’t be daunted by the number of steps in this pie–it is surprisingly simple to make, yes, even the marshmallows.</p><p>The biggest trick with the marshmallows is how messy they are. You’ll be tempted to break a strand of marshmallow between the bowl and your pie with your finger, it will then stick to your finger and you’ll use another finger to clean that one off and end up with sticky cobweb hands and strings of marshmallow everywhere, so don’t do it–use another spatula instead. Trust me, this has happened to me each time.</p><p>Of course, you could take a lot of shortcuts. You could buy an already-prepped graham cracker crust and/or you could line the chocolate layer with store-bought marshmallows and toast them instead. But then how would you play “Look! I’ve Got Spiderman Hands!” in the kitchen?</p><p><u>For crust</u><br>5 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter, melted, plus additional for greasing<br>1 1/2 cups cookie crumbs (10 graham crackers or 24 small gingersnaps; about 6 oz, pulsed in a food processor until finely ground)<br>2 tablespoons sugar<br>1/8 teaspoon salt (omitted if you use salted butter)</p><p><u>For chocolate cream filling</u><br>7 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not more than 70% cacao; not unsweetened), finely chopped<br>1 cup heavy cream<br>1 large egg, at room temperature for 30 minutes</p><p><u>For marshmallow topping</u><br>1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (from a 1/4-oz package)<br>1/2 cup cold water<br>3/4 cup sugar<br>1/4 cup light corn syrup<br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>Vegetable oil for greasing</p><p>Special equipment: a candy thermometer</p><p><u>Make graham cracker crust:</u> Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter pie 9- to 9 1/2-inch pie plate. Stir together all ingredients in a bowl and press evenly on bottom and up side of pie plate. Bake until crisp, 12 to 15 minutes, then cool on a rack to room temperature, about 45 minutes.</p><p><u>Make chocolate cream filling:</u> Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Put chocolate in a large bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, then pour hot cream over chocolate. Let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Gently whisk in egg and a pinch of salt until combined and pour into graham cracker crumb crust (crust will be about half full).</p><p>Cover edge of pie with a pie shield or foil and bake until filling is softly set and trembles slightly in center when gently shaken, about 25 minutes. Cool pie to room temperature on a rack (filling will firm as it cools), about 1 hour.</p><p><u>Make marshmallow topping:</u> Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup cold water in a large deep heatproof bowl and let stand until softened, about 1 minute.</p><p>Stir together sugar, corn syrup, a pinch of salt, and remaining 1/4 cup water in cleaned 1- to 1 1/4-quart heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then boil until thermometer registers 260°F, about 6 minutes.</p><p>Begin beating water and gelatin mixture with an electric mixer at medium speed, then carefully pour in hot syrup in a slow stream, beating (avoid beaters and side of bowl). When all of syrup is added, increase speed to high and continue beating until mixture is tripled in volume and very thick, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla and beat until combined, then immediately spoon topping onto center of pie filling; it will slowly spread to cover top of pie. Chill, uncovered, 1 hour, then cover loosely with lightly oiled plastic wrap (oiled side down) and chill 3 hours more.</p><p><u>Brown topping:</u> Preheat broiler. Transfer pie to a baking sheet. Cover edge of pie with pie shield or foil and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat, rotating pie as necessary, until marshmallow topping is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Cool pie on a rack 10 minutes. Slice pie with a large heavy knife dipped in hot water and then dried with a towel before cutting each slice.</p><p>[Alternately: I browned the topping with a creme brulee torch. It took some time and didn’t get as brown as I think it would have under the broiler (the pie was still cold, and hard to heat up with a small flame) but it does work in a pinch, or when you’re away from the oven.]</p><p><u>Note:</u> Pie (before browning topping) can be chilled up to 1 day.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-506 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-506 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
