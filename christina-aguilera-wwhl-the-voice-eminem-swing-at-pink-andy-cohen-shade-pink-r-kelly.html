She fearlessly tackled all three of his questions, addressing <strong><a href=#>Eminem's</a></strong> ongoing beef with her and those allegations <strong><a href=#>Pink</a></strong> made back in 2017 that Christina once tried to take a swing at her.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7f89d494-2760-5b0b-b5f9-84ef342f5a60 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f608dcf4-e7de-54a8-b75e-17e3b1a7a1db data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e9/5by4/2019/01/31/e9bb43180889518b8a578efe71ea2f32_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Christina Aguilera Gives Donut Shoppers Life with Surprise Songs About Them in Joyous Prank</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Look at her, look at me. I wouldn't swing on her," Christina laughed. "She's like-- she can beat my ass, are you kidding me? She could really beat my ass then."</p><p>In fact, Christina has a far different memory of her experience with Pink back in the day. "I seem to have a different memory of a night we had at a club where we played spin the bottle," she said. "I have a love memory, she has a bad memory."</p><p>Andy cleverly got her to admit that she remembered an actual kiss. "How did you know that?" she asked him, but he was just reading the conversation.</p><p>"I was excited about a kiss, I was like, 'Oh a kiss and all's good,'" Christina said. "Then she put up her hand like this and I was like, 'Oh, okay. That's what we're doing, alright.' She don't wanna get dirrty."</p><p>Christina was referencing the ages-ago beef between the women that surfaced after the recording of their megahit collaboration "Lady Marmalade."</p><p>" I know she has some feelings or whatever about how the recording of "Lady Marmalade" went down and all that," Christina recalled. "I know [on] the actual video, she intimidated me because she was heckling me a little bit behind the director and I was like, 'What's going on?' But that's what she did back then.</p><p>"But she's like a different person now, she's a mom, she's cool." And apparently the women are cool, too, as Christina infamous has another collaboration with Pink in the vault that both women are being very coy about, and she cited Pink as having the best vocals of her "rivals" from back in the day, <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></strong>, Pink, <strong><a href=#>Mandy Moore</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a></strong>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bf253210-9808-582f-bbe0-83714b30dd56 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f608dcf4-e7de-54a8-b75e-17e3b1a7a1db data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/75/5by4/2018/12/22/75cedcbd3ee5514fae723f1c4a0c138a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Demi Lovato Slams 'Sickening' Tabloid Stories After Overdose: 'Stop Writing About My Recovery'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>The Real Shady Eminem</h2><p>But while things seem to be good on the teen queen front, Andy had to ask why Christina thinks Eminem is still throwing shade at Aguilera after all these years. He first came after her in the lyrics of "The Real Slim Shady" in the early 2000s and now again last year in a freestyle.</p><p>"Yeah, I mean, that's real thirsty," Christina said, proving he's not the only one who can be shady. "I don't know what's going on there. That's real in the past and, you know, it was thirsty then it's thirsty now.</p><p>She went on to add, "It's not nice to go after anybody, especially a female in this business and now, what we're looking at and seeing come to the forefront, it's just, get a new gig. Have something else to talk about."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ffd0d76b-96bc-5fad-971f-18084be79725 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f608dcf4-e7de-54a8-b75e-17e3b1a7a1db data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2018/12/28/7fa7315211d05a37a53847192656c1ca_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">CBS/NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">14 Reasons Why Ariana Grande Was the Late-Night TV MVP of 2018</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Finding Her Voice</h2><p>While she may have avoided some questions, or outright misunderstood others, there was no doubt that Christina knew exactly what she wanted to say about her time on "The Voice" after appearing in seven of the first ten seasons. The show is heading into its 16th cycle.</p><p>"Well I can't knock it, I mean it was an experience in my life and I think everything has a learning curve and something to be experienced," Christina said carefully. And while she loved working with her teams over the years, the show wasn't exactly what she expected overall.</p><p>When Andy asked if she wasn't happy with how that experience turned out, Christina said, "Well-- That's a very complicated answer, but I just saw some ins and outs and inner workings that I was not happy."</p><p>Andy then tried a different angle, asking if the experience was a bit of a mixed bag for her, then? "I think that I did what I could with the position I was given and I have to keep it real on a certain level. I'm just, you know, I'm not a passive girl that's just gonna sit there and be okay with certain things."</p><p>But she would not elaborate on what those things were. "For me, I just know I needed to step away and get back to what I know that I love to do and how I could best give to the world in my own way," she said. And so she returned to her music.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:afd67fc4-536f-56ad-9b52-cb3b6f4e7700 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f608dcf4-e7de-54a8-b75e-17e3b1a7a1db data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ae/5by4/2019/01/19/ae6769c1a34f59a58627fa38d3477bf8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New R.

Kelly version of her Christina collaboration single "Do What U Want," Christina admitted that she'd watched the recent "Surviving R. Kelly" docuseries and found it to be very powerful.</p><p>"I was extremely moved by that whole show," she told Andy. "It was very heavy for me. I actually went through a lot of--" At this point, she trailed off in a meaningful way before redirecting her own thoughts by simply saying, "Let's not really go there, but it absolutely [touched me]."</p><p>She went on to speak more generally about coming up in this business from a very young age, as she did. "When you're in this business, you're exposed to so many predators and so many things," she said. "Watching what had happened to Aaliyah and everything, you're exposed to so much at such an early age."</p><p>She acknowledged that there is still a lot of work to be done to make the entertainment industry safer for young girls and women, but supported Gaga's decision fully. "I think she absolutely did the right thing," she said. "I love that she spoke and addressed it and she showed her support.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8744c8c5-e9fe-526a-a276-169570179678 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f608dcf4-e7de-54a8-b75e-17e3b1a7a1db data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/5by4/2019/01/27/b6a5fa47d4925f4e8d59f28c11a0f896_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">6 Reasons To Tune Into 'Rent: Live': 'Hamilton' Standout, 'Drag Race' Superstar and Vanessa Hudgens!</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Christina Draguilera</h2><p>The music, persona and wild styles of Christina Aguilera have resonated within the LGBTQ community for years and become a common go-to for drag queens looking to honor something instantly recognizable. As evidence, Andy brought out three drag queens representing different eras of Christina's career including "Lady Marmalade" and "Dirrty."</p><p>While all three were fierce in their own ways, it was up to Christina to make the final decision and see who would win the first-ever "Christina Draguilera Pageant."</p><p>We love the name, we love the concept, and we found ourselves absolutely torn between all three of them. Luckily, it wasn't up to us. Check out who Christina picked in the video above and see if she got it right.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
