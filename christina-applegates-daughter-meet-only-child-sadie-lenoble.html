But nothing can take away the joy and gratitude she feels as the mom of her beloved daughter, <a href=#><strong>Sadie Grace LeNoble</strong></a>.</p><p>The Dead to Me star shares her only child with her second husband, <strong>Martyn LeNoble</strong>. Christina and the Porno for Pyros band founder started dating following her divorce from her first spouse, <strong>Johnathon Schaech</strong>, whom she was married to from 2001 to 2007.</p><p>During the time Christina and the Dutch bassist made their relationship official in 2009, she had recently been diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, Martyn stepped up and became “an incredible part of [her] life.” While chatting with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in February 2013, Christina called her beau her “mighty support system.”</p><p>“Without him, I don’t know if I could’ve gone through any of it,” she sweetly shared with the outlet. “He came around at a time when there was a lot of loss in my life on many levels, so he’s been a really incredible help.”</p><p>Upon falling in love, Christina and the “She Sells Sanctuary” performer got engaged on Valentine’s Day 2010, and before they had the chance to walk down the aisle, they started their family. The <a href=#>Married with Children</a> star gave birth to their daughter, Sadie, in 2011, and the lovebirds later wed in February 2013.</p><p>Christina credits her handsome husband for being a constant support amid her struggles, but the <a href=#>Emmy</a> winner said it’s Sadie who has “healed [her] in so many ways.” During an interview with <a href=#>People</a> following Sadie’s birth, Christina gushed over the “miracle” of motherhood.</p><p>“You can’t explain it … she’s just made my life so much better,” the Vacation star marveled. “I’ve been sad for a long time and she’s just opened my soul.”</p><p>Reflecting on her journey to parenthood, Christina said she didn’t realize how much she was missing out on until she held her baby in her arms for the first time. “That was the piece of the puzzle that hadn’t been there, and now it’s there,” she proclaimed. “It’s a great feeling of renewal. It’s a beginning. She’s my beginning.”</p><p>In November 2022, Christina received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In her speech, she thanked her little girl for bringing a light into her life.</p><p>“The most important person in this world is my daughter,” she said at the time. “You are so much more than even you know. You are so beautiful and kind and loving and smart and interesting.”</p><p>The Anchorman actress continued, “I’m blessed every day that I get to wake up and take you to school. You are my everything. Thank you for standing by me through all of this.”</p><p><strong>To learn more about Sadie, keep scrolling!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cn6uho6m2r62MmqeppJWcrrWx0mabmq2XncGmvoymnJ6sXaS7rcWMnJ%2BipJRiwKKwyJ5kpZ2epK%2BtsY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deborah-ann-woll.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deborah Ann Woll Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2016-rodeo-houston-lineup.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2016 Rodeo Houston Lineup Announced</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
