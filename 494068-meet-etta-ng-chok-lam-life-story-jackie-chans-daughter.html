From a complicated relationship with her parents to her coming out as a lesbian, Etta is no stranger to being the local subject of Hong Kong's media headlines. Here are surprising facts about her.</p><h3>1. She was born out of wedlock to celebrity parents</h3><p class=align-left>In 1999, Chan, who is legally married to actress Joan Lin with whom he has a son, Jaycee Chan, was caught in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">vicious scandal </a>after he admitted having an extramarital affair with actress Elaine Ng. He profusely apologised to his wife and confessed that the former 1990 Miss Asia winner was pregnant.</p><p class=align-left>On November 19, 1999, Etta Ng Chok was born. However, Jackie Chan had cut contact with Elaine, so Etta did not take her biological father's last name. Both Jackie Chan and Elaine Wu are in the <a href=#>film industry</a>. Etta's birth drove massive media attention due to her father's epic action movie roles. As a result, she was nicknamed Little Dragon Girl.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2826ca7d076f7d09.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Lil Mama? All the latest updates about the rapper</span></p></a><h3>2. Etta's relationship with her father is almost non-existent</h3><p class=align-left>The 23-year-old youngster disclosed that she does not recognise Jackie Chan as her father as she was entirely raised by her mother and did not see him while growing up. Although she claims not to hold any grudges against him, she chooses not to meet him or amend their relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, Etta seems far from her tycoon father's thoughts. When Chan was asked about financially supporting his only daughter, his response said that he believed she doesn't need his inheritance, adding that he prefers not talking about some stuff.</p><h3>3. She identifies herself as a lesbian and is open about her relationship</h3><p class=align-left>In 2017, Ng came out of the closet to announce her sexuality. She is married to Andi Autumn, who was her long-term Canadian girlfriend. Andi is also a social media influencer and, over ten years, Etta's senior.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8686b292f979c62.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is actress Eva Hauge? Here's everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She posted their marriage certificate on Instagram, showing that they both said their marital vows on November 8, 2018. The announcement drew much attention from Chinese society, especially on the Weibo platform. However, unlike Elaine, Jackie Chan said he was okay with her daughter's sexual orientation if she was.</p><h3>4. Her strained relationship with Asia made her drop out of school</h3><p class=align-left>Despite being raised by a single mother, Etta's relationship with her mother is complicated. This hostile relationship was revealed to the public when Etta claimed her mother was cruel and abusive. However, she admits that her <a href=#>world</a> revolves around her mother. The celeb's daughter dropped out of school because of the <a href=# title>strained relationship.</a></p><p class=align-left>The former Miss pageant Asia revealed that her daughter struggled with various emotional problems and needed medical assistance. She was under psychological therapy for a short period before she began skipping classes when she moved from Hong Kong to Canada.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8589041eb73ece63.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Grace Fan DeVito?

Despite her mother not agreeing with her sexuality, through her social media platforms, Etta continues to talk to other gay people to come out of the closet.</p><h3>5. Etta once claimed to be homeless in a YouTube video</h3><p class=align-left>In April 2018, Etta released a YouTube video that featured Autumn. In the video, Jackie Chan's daughter claimed to be homeless, a situation that had compelled her to sleep under a bridge. She blamed her condition on the homophobic society, which made her move to Canada to marry a same-sex partner.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, due to her sexual orientation, her relatives, including her mother, had severed all ties with the <a href=#>young lady</a>. The duo had initially lived at an acquaintance's place in Canada before the latter stopped helping them. She was once reported to queue for free food in Canada.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1bb180014d2c4a7d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Janine Tate: What you didn't know about Andrew Tate's sister</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although Etta has a billionaire father, she has not yet asked for financial support from him. Instead, she asked for help from the video claiming neither the <a href=#>police officers</a> nor the LGBTQ+ community had offered any assistance to them.</p><p class=align-left>How is it possible for Jackie Chan's daughter to live in poverty? When the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hong Kong website</a> Coconuts met Elaine for a comment, she condemned her daughter's act saying that it was wrong and that if they were financially unstable, they should have looked for jobs instead.</p><p class=align-left>Etta Ng Chok Lam, the youngest of Jackie Chan's two children, is a free spirit and not your typical celebrity child. Despite many controversies surrounding the young lady and her complicated relationship with her parents, Etta does what her mind tells her. She is proudly lesbian, and despite the over ten years age difference, she left Hong Kong to marry her wife, Andi Autumn.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2fd5beda73296729.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sophia Wanuna parents, tribe, relationships, child, and career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about <a href=#>Johnny Gargano</a>.
