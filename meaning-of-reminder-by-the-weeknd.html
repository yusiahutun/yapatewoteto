Here, the themes of authenticity and staying true to oneself emerge. The Weeknd highlights the importance of embracing his unique identity, represented by his black hair and weed smoke, as opposed to conforming to industry expectations.The line, "And I swear too much on the regular, We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go," highlights the artist's rebellious spirit and refusal to be censored. It speaks to the theme of individuality and freedom of expression. The Weeknd is unapologetic for his language and confident in his ability to create chart-topping hits regardless.Moving further into the song, the lyrics, "I just won a new award for a kids show, Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow, I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice, Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy," introduce themes of progression and pushing boundaries. The Weeknd reflects on his career evolution, acknowledging his growth from controversial and edgy music to mainstream recognition. These lyrics challenge the notion of categorization and embrace the shift from being a "teen choice" artist to a more mature and versatile musician.Continuing with, "Whip game, make a nigga understand though, Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo, Hit the gas so hard make it rotate," the artist further emphasizes his success and the luxurious lifestyle that comes with it. The car-related imagery symbolizes the fast pace of his life, as well as his ability to captivate his audience. The themes of power and influence emerge here, highlighting The Weeknd's ability to make an impact both musically and personally."All my niggas blew up like a propane, All these R&B niggas be so lame," delves into themes of competition and standing out from the crowd. The Weeknd asserts his dominance in the industry, acknowledging how his peers pale in comparison. This lyric showcases the artist's belief in his own unique artistry and his refusal to blend in with the masses.The lyrics, "Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor, Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight, That good sex, we'll sweat it out, Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out," introduce themes of transformation and success. These lines depict The Weeknd's journey from humble beginnings to a life of opulence. They also allude to personal growth and the artist's ability to overcome struggles.
