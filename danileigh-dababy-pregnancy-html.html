As&nbsp;the camera panned over to capture her response, the singer's pronounced baby bump was there for everyone to see.&nbsp;</p><p>This clip, in particular, came into circulation sometime in April, but the rumors of her pregnancy were prevalent from as early as March 2021.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Where It All Started</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In March 2021, DaniLeigh sparked pregnancy rumors on Twitter when she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attended</a> an event. The media coverage from that event displayed, what looked like, a baby bump&nbsp;on the singer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Although the bump was not as visible as in the previously discussed YouTube video, it was enough to get the Twitterati talking.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>I know my eyes ðŸ‘€ aren’t playing tricks on me! ðŸ™€ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚</p><p>This girl IS PREGNANT ðŸ¤°ðŸÂÂ¾ðŸ‘€ <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Danileigh</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/YcXCCDCFvV</a> — TEASIPPERS ðŸÂÂ¸â˜•ï¸ÂÂ (@_trtzfnl_TV) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 8, 2021</a></p><p>While they were on the subject, the netizens pinned <a href=# rel=follow>DaBaby</a> as the baby's father since he was in a relationship with the singer up until February 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>DaniLeigh has yet to make an official statement on the subject.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>DaBaby & DaniLeigh's Relationship Timeline</h2><p>The whirlwind romance between <a href=# rel=follow>DaBaby</a> and DaniLeigh first made it to the public eye in December 2020 when she posted an intimate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">snap</a> of the two on her Instagram.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The now-deleted selfie featured DaniLeigh hugging her beau from behind while making eye contact with the lens.</p><p>The boyfriend, on the other hand, did not face the camera and had a more serious expression on his face. Both of them were clad in matching white t-shirts.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But as of February 2021, DaniLeigh was "Officially single," or so she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a> in an Instagram story.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Backlash on Her Socials</h2><p>DaniLeigh had been subjected to a lot of backlash for previewing her song 'Yellow Bone' on Instagram just a few weeks before her breakup.</p><p>Fans <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">called</a> her out for colorism and voiced their opinions regarding the song almost instantly.&nbsp;She later removed the video from her Instagram and put up an apology video in response. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the latter video, she explained that she had been&nbsp;misunderstood and was just expressing what her then-boyfriend, DaBaby, liked.&nbsp;</p><h2>Opposite Ends of the Spectrum</h2><p>The Twitterati were divided into two camps during the online feud.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"I genuinely hope that DaniLeigh is ok," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> one user.&nbsp;"Breakups do suck and the fact that WOMEN are out here making fun of her because she’s single now does not sit right with me." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Looooooool so danileigh made that song about her man wanting her cos her bones are yellow and what not and now she’s single ? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ — MELA (@melasface) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">February 7, 2021</a></p><p>While a few resonated with that train of thought, others were simply not that kind to her.
