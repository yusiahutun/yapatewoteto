However, UK host Paddy McGuiness has recently shared a story that was shocking even for Harry, and it involves his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s ‘wild days’, before marrying <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, were widely documented by the paparazzi. From <a href=#>smoking 20 cigarettes</a> a day, to sneaking into London clubs through the fire escape, the paps caught it all. However, it looks like there was one moment that may have slipped the lens. Luckily, Paddy’s here to spill the gossip.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-88074306-852x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-ripped-down-queen-s-photo-in-underground-london-club>Prince Harry ‘ripped down Queen’s photo’ in underground London club</h2><p>Although the paps didn’t catch this underground moment, it looks like one <a href=#>TV</a> host did.</p><p>Speaking on the Restless Natives Podcast, Paddy said: “I was talking to one of the security lads at the end because there was all sorts going on.</p><p>“He [Harry] was ripping my t-shirt off, snogging and kissing me, and ripped a photo of the <a href=#>Queen</a> off the wall and said ‘I can’t have her watching me doing this’.”</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit and GRV Media have contacted Prince Harry’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><p>Speaking on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moment</a> to GB News, <a href=#>royal</a> biographer Angela Levin, who spent 15 months with the Duke revealed the 39-year-old still feels like his mother, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, is looking down on him.</p><p>“And that she is guiding him what to do, that she’s watching him very very carefully, he does feel that,” she explained.</p><p>“He feels the same for the Queen, his grandmother, that she is looking down, and she would be shocked by what he was doing, so he didn’t want to see her. In other words, he thought he was behaving very badly,” however she calls the actions ‘childlike’ and ‘bizarre’.</p><p>Angela also speaks on how Harry has become “miserable and unpleasant” in recent years. His <a href=#>popularity, along with Meghan’s has plummeted</a>, although, at one point, he was the most popular royal of all time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-995715962-1024x708.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-duke-is-now-a-changed-man>The Duke is now ‘a changed man’</h2><p>Harry has definitely put the party days behind him as he’s now a husband, and a dad to two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.</p><p>Royals <a href=#>release Christmas cards</a> each year on tradition, and even though the Sussex’s left the establishment, it’s one thing that they’ve carried on doing.</p><p>However, unlike Prince William and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>‘s cards, the children weren’t included in theirs. In fact, the <a href=#>couple</a> sent an e-card with a photo of the two clapping at the Invictus Games earlier this year.</p><p>The text, sent via email, read: “We wish you a very Happy Holiday season.
