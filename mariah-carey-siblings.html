Mariah Carey has two siblings an older sister named <strong>Alison Carey</strong> and an older brother named <strong>Morgan Carey</strong>.</p><p><strong>Alison Carey</strong> is the eldest of the three siblings. She has made public accusations of abuse against their mother, Patricia, and has been estranged from Mariah for many years. Alison has struggled with homelessness and addiction and has made claims against Mariah in the media.</p><p><strong>Morgan Carey</strong> is the older brother of Mariah. He has cerebral palsy and has spoken publicly about the challenges he has faced in his life. Morgan has also had a strained relationship with Mariah, and they have not been close in recent years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Are Mariah Carey Siblings?</h2><p>Mariah Carey, the “Songbird Supreme,” needs no introduction. But behind the iconic five-octave voice and chart-topping hits lies a complex family history. Nestled alongside Mariah’s dazzling career are the stories of her siblings, <strong>Alison and Morgan</strong>, whose lives have taken vastly different paths, often intertwined with their famous sister’s success and shadowed by personal struggles.</p><p>Born in 1969 to Patricia Hickey and Alfred Roy Carey, Mariah was the youngest of three children. Her older siblings, Alison (born in 1960) and Morgan (born in 1960), faced a challenging childhood marked by racial prejudice, financial instability, and parental discord. Their parents’ interracial marriage faced societal disapproval, adding to the difficulties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mariah-Carey-Siblings-2-1200x662.jpg><p>Following their parents’ separation in 1973, the siblings’ paths diverged. Alison went to live with their father, while Mariah and Morgan remained with their mother. This early separation laid the foundation for a complex and often strained relationship between them.</p><p>Alison’s life has been a stark contrast to her sister’s. She battled addiction and homelessness for years, fueled by unresolved childhood trauma and estrangement from her family. In 2020, she published a memoir detailing her experiences, including accusations of abuse and exploitation within the family, further straining the already fragile relationship with Mariah.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Alison has shown resilience. She has actively raised awareness about mental health and addiction, advocating for support and understanding. Her story offers a glimpse into the often-overlooked realities behind the glitz and glamour of celebrity families.</p><p>Morgan Carey, the eldest sibling, carved his path in the music industry. Though overshadowed by his sister’s meteoric rise, he found success as a producer and songwriter, collaborating with artists like Mary J. Blige and Puff Daddy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mariah-Carey-Siblings-3-1200x683.jpg><p>However, Morgan’s journey hasn’t been without hurdles. He battled cerebral palsy and seizures from a young age, demonstrating remarkable strength and perseverance. While he maintains a relatively private life, his achievements deserve recognition, showcasing the diverse ways siblings can navigate their identities beyond the shadow of a famous figure.</p><p>The relationship between <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> and her siblings remains complex and fraught with tension. Public disagreements and legal battles have fueled media scrutiny and speculation. Whether true reconciliation is possible remains an open question.</p><p>However, their stories offer valuable insights into the dynamics of family, fame, and individual struggles. Mariah’s siblings, often relegated to the fringes of her narrative, deserve their own space in the spotlight, not as mere footnotes, but as individuals with their journeys and experiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mariah-Carey-Siblings-1-1200x594.jpg><p>While <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>‘s name lights up marquees, the lives of her siblings offer a counterpoint, reminding us that family narratives are rarely black and white.
