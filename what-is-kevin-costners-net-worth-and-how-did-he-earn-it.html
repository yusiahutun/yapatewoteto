He grew up with his parents Sharon Rae and William Costner, and two siblings in California, nurturing his secret dreams of someday becoming an actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220930_035330.png><p>That dream eventually materialized after an encounter with famed actor Richard Burton, who encouraged him to chase his ambitions. Costner eventually abandoned his degree in marketing and finance and focused on his longtime ambition.</p><p>A brief stint in a 1974 film paved the way for the star in the industry, and by the eighties, he boasted of a full-blown career as an actor. Those dreams eventually paid off.</p><p>Over the years, he branched into other spheres of entertainment and even returned to his business roots. Today, Kevin Costner is considered a Hollywood living legend, with a substantial net worth to back his career escapades.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_Of_Kevin_Costner></span><strong>What Is The Net Worth Of Kevin Costner?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of September 2022, Kevin Costner has a net worth of $250,000,000 per <a href=#>CelebrityNetworth</a>. The amount comes as no surprise given how far the actor has come since his early days in Hollywood.</p><p>In fact, his career has seen him branch into a handful of entertainment ventures including acting, film and television production, singing and modeling. He has also made some tremendous investments, with a multimillion-dollar business at the center of his empire.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Kevin_Costner_Become_So_Wealthy></span><strong>How Did Kevin Costner Become So Wealthy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Most of Kevin Costner’s life’s work has centered around acting, which he is most notable for. In fact, he reportedly earned up to six figures per episode of “Yellowstone,” one of his latest projects.</p><p>He dabbled into acting in the mid-seventies, but only made his film debut in 1981’s “Sizzle Beach.” More projects followed in the next decades. Overall, Costner boasts of about 60 motion picture appearances and counting.</p><p>Some of his major projects include “Field Of Creams,” “Dances With Wolves,” “The Untouchables,” “Silverado,” “Revenge,” “13 Days,” “The Postman” and “Yellowstone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220930_035311.png><p>He also branched into film production and directing, blessing the world with more of his unmatched talents.</p><p>Later in his <a href=#>career</a>, he tried his hands at music, forming the band, Kevin Costner and Modern West. The group boasts of at least four studio albums and appearances in numerous concerts and festivals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kevin_Costners_Business_ventures_Boosted_His_Net_worth></span><strong>Kevin Costner’s Business ventures Boosted His Net worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After years in the spotlight, Costner decided to create his own business empire. He purchased Ocean Therapy Solutions from the US Government in 1995 for $24 million. The company specializes in water purification techniques used to mitigate the effects of oil spills.</p><p>Costner’s company famously came to the rescue following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Ocean Therapy snagged a contract of $52 million for cleanup efforts.</p><p>Another business venture under his name is Midnight Star, a casino in Deadwood, South Dakota. He closed the company in 2017 but it has since been reopened under new management.</p><p>Still looking to grow in the <a href=#>business</a> world, Costner invested in sports at some point. He became the partial owner of the baseball team, Lake County Fielders. The North American League team was disbanded in 2012.</p><p>In addition to these, Costner has a host of real estate investments and landed properties in states like California and Colorado.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Costner_Up_To_Now></span><strong>What Is Costner Up To Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After a long-lived career, Kevin Costner has garnered an impressive <a href=#>net worth</a> that could last a lifetime.

He has been married twice, first to his college sweetheart Cindy Silva in 1978. They had three children together.</p><p>Following their divorce sixteen years later, Costner dated Bridget Rooney, who bore him a son. Then in 2004, he exchanged vows again, with model and handbag designer Christine Baumgartner. Their marriage yielded three children.</p><p>Indeed, Kevin Costner’s life depicts the classic story of a man born to become a legend, who seized opportunities and threaded the right course on his path to fame and fortune.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKmt02agrGWbmsOquoycpqysnpq%2FtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5wKebZqCfrHqltcNmn55llZa%2Fr3nIrWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tish-cyrus-shares-whats-different-about-her-marriage-to-dominic-purcell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'He Encourages Me To Fly'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-jo-morgan-wedgeworth-dec-30-1924-april-15-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Jo Morgan Wedgeworth, Dec. 30, 1924-April 15, 2022 | Obituaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
