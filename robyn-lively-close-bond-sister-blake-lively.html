"We have so many similarities. Our relationship is on a deeper level. We used to help each other with our projects and lines, things like that. Now we're doing the mom thing together."</p><p>"I genuinely feel like her children are mine as if I gave birth to them, and vice versa," she added with a laugh. "We're like, 'Your children are mine too.' Our relationship has only gotten richer and fuller."</p><p>Robyn and Blake are half-sisters and have the same mother, Elaine Lively. Robyn shares three children with husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/bartjohnson>Bart Johnson</a>: Baylen, 19, Kate, 17, and Wyatt, 14. Like Robyn, Blake also has three kids that she shares with husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/ryanreynolds>Ryan Reynolds</a>: James, 7, Inez, 5, and Betty, 2.</p><p>Since they are "so in tune" with one another and the other's children, the "Doogie Howser, M.D." star said she and Blake don't feel the need to give each other advice about motherhood.</p><p>"I've learned so much from her, and she’s learned so much from me," Robyn told Fox News Digital. "I never go in and say, 'Hey, you should really do this.' I think we're constantly observing and learning from each other. I see things that she does with her kids, and I’m like, 'Oh, that is so great. That’s so wonderful and special.' Or I'll go, 'I love how she handled that' and then implement that in my life with my kids. And she does the same. It's like you don't have to have those types of conversations because you're so in tune [as sisters]. And we've had so many shared experiences together."</p><p>Speaking about his wife and sister-in-law's relationship, Johnson, 51, said, "I'll say from my perspective, they're like the same person. They've got the same energy and the same sense of humor. They're also so connected and love each other so much."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f41af7c2-68da-4901-80d4-35243570d804 data-container-ref=toofab:article:38a21bec-3f78-440a-89a0-4f7a18b163f1 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/56/5by4/2022/06/22/56cdfff6394f49f1afca709290fd683e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ryan Reynolds Goes Deep on 'Brutal Mistakes' in Parenting and How Not to Waste Them</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It's really gone a long way since Robyn was on 'Savannah' and Blake would come to hang out on set as a little girl," he added, referencing the 1996 soap opera. "Now it feels like that age gap has closed… Our kids are the center of our entire universe. [Robyn and Blake] share the love and the passion for motherhood. They’re best friends. It’s such a charming friendship. It's a beautiful thing."</p><p>Meanwhile, also during the interview, Robyn and Johnson spoke about their career, including what it was like working together in their new film, "Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters," in which they play a husband and wife on-screen.</p><p>The couple -- who will celebrate their 23rd wedding anniversary next month -- also discussed why they choose certain projects, with Robyn explaining the significance of being involved with family-friend projects. ("Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters" is available to stream on Pure Flix, which produces faith and family entertainment.)</p><p>"I see shows now, and I feel like Hollywood is trying so hard to push the envelope and I just don't think it's necessary," she told Fox News Digital. "I think we're just oversaturated with stuff like that. So to be part of a project where you can share it with the whole family and offer a great message, it's so important. And I think people are craving for that. I'm super proud to be part of a film like this one. It’s sweet, it’s funny, and I can tell anybody to watch this. I'm so confident of it."</p><p>"It does feel like the priority has been to push the envelope and how dark we can go," she added. "That's what everybody is doing now. So this feels pretty unique in that we can just focus on the story and the relationships between family members, which has plenty of drama and conflict -- relatable conflict for us. It's really enjoyable to just not have any sort of agenda other than telling a great story."</p><a id=gallery-link-6e6800e7-94bd-453e-b2e8-149d129086b7 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:6e6800e7-94bd-453e-b2e8-149d129086b7 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:38a21bec-3f78-440a-89a0-4f7a18b163f1 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5e/4by3/2023/04/28/5e9c1195784b49fb944b82013927ab0e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3FmanBfp7yjxc1mo6KulaHGbq%2FLqKqeZZKku6V50qKqrZ2iYq%2BtrcqeZKWhppq5uns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tristyn-lee-bio-family-career-relationship-girlfriend-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tristyn Lee Bio, Family, Career, Relationship, Girlfriend, and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-william-cheated-harry-clue.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince William Cheated: Prince Harry Clue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
