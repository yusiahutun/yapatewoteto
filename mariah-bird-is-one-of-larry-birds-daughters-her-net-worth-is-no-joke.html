Larry Bird is a former basketball player turned coach and executive director of the National Basketball Association.&nbsp;</p><p>Larry’s career as an athlete was very successful, and he is believed by many to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He is also a family man.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/larr.jpg><p>Larry has been married twice; his first wife was Janet Condra. After their marriage crashed, he moved on with Dinah Mattingly, to whom he is still married today.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with Mariah Bird, Larry has two other kids. They all get along, and Larry has a great relationship with them.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Mariah_Bird></span>Who Is Mariah Bird?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mariah Bird is one of the kids Larry Bird adopted with his second wife, Dinah Mattingly. She does not know her biological parents and has made no attempts to find them to respect their privacy.</p><p>As she was adopted, some details about her and her biological parents remain mysterious. For instance, her birth date is unknown, but she is believed to have been born sometime in the 1990s in Indianapolis, USA.&nbsp;</p><p>Larry and Mattingly adopted Mariah and her brother Conner Bird because they could not have children. Mariah’s third sibling is Corrie Bird.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mari.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Mariah_Bird_Do></span>What Does Mariah Bird Do?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mariah reportedly enjoyed basketball intensely while growing up; however, her desires started to change as she got older. She graduated from Boston University with a degree in science and recreation, then went on to further her studies at Indiana University.&nbsp;</p><p>Mariah was very passionate about cheerleading in her formative years as a teenager and decided to make a career off it. Her career kicked off as a cheerleader for a local basketball team, where she would organize all the cheerleaders and coordinate chants and performances.</p><p>After her time there, Mariah started working as an event trainee for a company, gaining experience. Her experience was of great merit to her, putting her on the radar of some serious companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Mariah Bird is an event manager for Pacers Sports & Entertainment. She is also worth a whopping $950,000 and lives in a $2.35 million mansion owned by her father. Her salary as an event planner ranges around $80,000 annually, so the future looks bright for her.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Mariah_Bird_Larrys_Biological_Daughter></span>Is Mariah Bird Larry’s Biological Daughter?&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Mariah Bird is not Larry Bird’s biological daughter. That would be Corrie Bird, Mariah’s sister. They are the only females among Larry’s three kids. The third is Conner, he is also adopted.&nbsp;</p><p>Corrie was the first among the three to call Larry father, as she was his first and only biological child. She is the product of his marriage to Jane Condra and the alleged heir to her father’s fortune.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/laaaa-1.jpg><p>Corrie now works in healthcare, while Conner is still most popular because of who Larry is. Conner has made the headlines a couple of times because of his brush with the law, but he seems to have mellowed down recently, as there has been no negative news about him on the internet.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Larry_Birds_Adopted_Daughter_Married></span>Is Larry Bird’s Adopted Daughter Married?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As far as the public knows, Mariah Bird is currently not married. Despite her ties to fame, Mariah prefers to live a lowkey life, so she does not talk much about her private affairs in public.&nbsp;</p><p>As it stands, it is unknown whether Mariah is seeing anyone or if she has even had a secret marriage she’s chosen to keep under wraps. If there is a man in her life, she keeps that fact hidden, so her fans may have to wait a little longer before they can expect the wedding bells to ring for her.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Mariah_Birds_Mother></span>Who Is Mariah Bird’s Mother?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mariah’s adoptive mother is Dinah Mattingly, her father’s current wife. The couple tied the knot in 1989 and have been together ever since.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Larry, Dinah also prefers to live under the radar. She hardly ever attends public events and, when she does, tries to avoid the limelight. Their marriage has endured a lot, but perhaps this character disparity has made that possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, fans are glad <a href=#>Larry Bird</a> has someone he can share the rest of his days with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqK%2ByJqfZpqZp7FutdJmpqedXaSzbrjAq6myZZKev6W%2FjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzv4yhnKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZZmoeq%2B7jKOmpJ1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-marc-jacobson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Peter Marc Jacobson dating?
