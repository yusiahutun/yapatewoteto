Whether you're looking for a relaxed night with friends or are in the mood to turn up, it's important to dress appropriately so that you have the best time possible feeling the best you possibly can.</p><p>Below, we've broken down what to wear this Independence Day for your various holiday plans and picked the best patriotic outfits for the occasion. Read through our list, find your style and help us help you celebrate America the right way!</p><p><strong>If you're going to the beach/pier:</strong></p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/o/2015/07/01/abf968a3ebdd5131860c6834a954b594_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>If you're watching the nighttime 'works from a beach or pier, shorts are your best friend. This cute-casual number from <a href=#><strong>Macy's</strong></a> can be as dressed up or as dressed down as you like. Wedges and sandals are both perfectly acceptable accompaniments, so you'll fit in regardless of how posh or chill your beachside gathering may be. Plus, with shorts, you won't have to deal with every girl's perpetual dilemma of whether to wear a dress or jeans. And depending on the breeze (or lack thereof), your sleeveless cardigan can be easily removed and tied around your waist as part of your relaxed, patriotic look.</p><p><strong>If you're going to a BBQ:</strong></p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/o/2015/07/01/3a5a665a58e7598d8d2d6580880dcdb6_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>If you're celebrating the Fourth the old fashioned way – with a daytime BBQ – you'll definitely want to wear something comfy, cute, and of course, patriotic. Being that you'll likely spend your day outside, shades are a must. And so are flats. So we suggest this little ensemble from <a href=#><strong>Nordstrom</strong></a>. The color scheme is on point. Plus, you won't feel too hot or uncomfortable. And these overalls are a great way to bring a retro element to a modern look. Just don't go crazy with the '90s trend. (Leave your scrunchies at home.)</p><p><strong>If you're going to a pool party:</strong></p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/be/o/2015/07/01/be62ba9e2423591ca354485533c21896_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Perhaps the most common way to observe summer's biggest holiday is by a pool. This is the time to whip out that cliché American flag bikini that absolutely no one can judge you for. But if you're looking for a new way to be poolside patriotic, try this swimsuit from<a href=#><strong> Urban Outfitters</strong></a>. Not only do the top and bottom create perfect Independence Day harmony, they are also great as separates. So you're actually getting more bang for your buck by opting for solids instead of stars and stripes.</p><p><strong>If you're going to a bar:</strong></p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/o/2015/07/01/dcf569ee7d2f582d9aa9616f6e3141a3_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>If you and your friends are looking to go out, but not go out out, a bar is your best bet. Because you don't have the pressure of wearing a string bikini or some super tight body-con dress, you have free reign to sport the classic sundress…even if it's nighttime…because #merica. This simple cotton number from <a href=#><strong>Lulu's</strong></a> pairs perfectly with nude or white wedges and a matching fedora. And the best part about wearing white is that you have the liberty of wearing whichever red or blue accessories you wish! Just don't go overboard. The beauty of this outfit is its simplicity.</p><p><strong>If you're going to the club:</strong></p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/o/2015/07/01/e6b443144d0b5ec1aafcd94f38f30409_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>If you're going all out for America's birthday, go all out. This is neither the time nor the place for flats. Feel super sexy in this getup from <a href=#><strong>Nasty Gal</strong></a> (but may we suggest pasties?) while still feeling comfortable enough to move around and dance. The matching skirt and knit crop top pair perfectly with these peep-toe pumps. And don't worry about being too red – it's the Fourth of July! If there's any day to sport all red everything, it's today.</p><p>Happy shopping, and Happy Fourth!</p><p>Which look do you like the best?
