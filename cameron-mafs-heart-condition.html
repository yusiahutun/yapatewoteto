And while he didn’t explain in full detail, <a href=#>Cameron from <a href=# id=auto-tag_mafs data-tag=mafs>MAFS</a>’ heart condition</a> has fans of the show worried. The season 17 cast member had butted heads with his wife, Clare, throughout the season, which he said may have made things worse.</p><p>The Lifetime TV show was created in July 2014 on FYI. The premise derives from the&nbsp;Danish TV show&nbsp;Gift Ved Første Blik.&nbsp;The first season took place in New York City and New Jersey and showed off three couples, who like the show describes, are married when they first meet each other.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/married-at-first-sight-australia-season-11-sara-tim.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/michael-married-at-first-sight.png><p>The couples then spend time together on their honeymoon and spend eight weeks together living a family lifestyle. After eight weeks, they get to decide <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>whether they want to divorce</a> or stay together on Decision Day. There are several experts on the show that examine the couples’ compatibility with each other. For season 17, experts Pastor Cal and Dr. Pepper are reunited in the host city of Denver, Colorado, along with&nbsp;Dr. Pia, who joins the show as a full-time expert.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking to&nbsp;E! News,&nbsp;Dr. Pepper Schwartz <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed the tedious process</a> of making the couples. Hundreds of people apply to the show and the experts go to churches, bars, dating apps or anywhere that people meet to “make the prospective pool as big as people.” There’s more steps to the vetting process including a meet-and-greet, several interview sessions and psychological and background checks. The final step is a home visit from Dr. Pepper.&nbsp;</p><p>“My hope was that we would be able to support these people and help them grow into better versions of themselves by bringing out skills to the process, by matching them through science and maybe this really could work and it could work even beyond helping these people grow and get more information about themselves, but to give them skills. And to augment what we hoped was already thought was a good match according to our scientific tools. And the more we went on, the more I believed in it because I could see people listen and learn and it was fascinating and wonderful. She continued, “It worked out beyond my wildest fantasies.”</p><p>Pastor Cal told the&nbsp;site&nbsp;about <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>his views on marriage</a> on the show. “I’ve learned and tell couples now that marriage doesn’t work—people work. And quite often, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>we want the marriage to work</a>,” he said. “Sometimes we want to blame the marriage and say the marriage is not working, but it’s you. You’re not working. You’re not doing the things that are necessary. You’re not communicating and not being vulnerable. You got to be kind. You got to be honest. And you’re gonna have to put in the time and don’t give up too quickly.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=cameron-from-mafs-heart-condition>Cameron from MAFS‘ heart condition</h2><p>In the episode that aired on January 10, 2023, Cameron revealed that he needed to undergo serious surgery. “I’ve developed a heart condition. The doctors don’t really have much to say other than I’m going to need a procedure done on my heart,” he told the cameras. Later, he pondered his heart condition. “Did the stress of my separation from Clare lead to this heart problem? Um, it was probably something that was going to happen, maybe it accelerated it.”</p><p>Cameron explained that he’d need to have surgery in a few weeks and avoid anything that gets his heart rate over 100, which could cause permanent damage to the organ. The scene concluded with Cameron monitoring his heart rate on his watch, observing that it didn’t look like it was going to go down. He didn’t go so far as to explain the specifics of his condition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>While Cameron and Clare seemed to have good chemistry at the time of their wedding, tensions began to show as early as their honeymoon when they clashed several times over their core values, including how to raise children and their different views on therapy.</p><p>In episode 11 of&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_married-at-first-sight data-tag=married-at-first-sight>Married at First Sight</a>, Clare and Cameron decided to divorce after 31 days of marriage. “On the count of three, say if you want a divorce or you want to keep trying,” he said to Clare. One, two, three: “Divorce,” they both said.&nbsp;</p><p>According to ShowBiz Cheat Sheet: “Clare is a quadruplet and a therapist. She’s family-oriented but also independent. Her ideal partner will appreciate that she values her alone time. Clare is also fitness-focused and disciplined, and she wants an equal partnership with her future husband.&nbsp;Clare’s husband-to-be is Cameron.</p><p>A native of New Zealand, he’s an entrepreneur who owns a bike shop. His ideal wife is slender, healthy, and into physical activities. She also needs to be adventurous. Cameron—who describes himself as reliable and trustworthy—has been single since his last relationship ended a year ago, but he’s ready to settle down with the right partner.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
