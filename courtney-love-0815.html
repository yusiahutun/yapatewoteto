I was watching her on TV at my stepfather's house, and she said something like, "I wish someone had told me when I was younger to start taking care of my skin." So even though I was in the fifth grade, I did what she said. My stepfather was married to a Ford model at the time, and she would let me use some of her products but never her Erno Laszlo, so I started sneaking the Erno Laszlo soap. I got into huge trouble for it. This was around 1977, when Erno Laszlo was, like, all the shit. She had brought it from New York. These days I use SK-II products and ReVive moisturizer. If a product doesn't work, it goes straight into the moisturizer bucket in the sky. And no matter what, I always take my makeup off at night—that's important. But for whatever reason, I have genetically good skin. People in my family can become overweight, but they don't wrinkle. I'm blessed that way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For me, vanity trumps bad habits. There was a period when I got quite heavy, and I had to do a magazine shoot. They Photoshopped the pictures, but I got ahold of the un-Photoshopped versions and put them on my fridge. After that I went to great lengths to lose the weight. I put my daughter's carbs in a secret drawer where I couldn't find them and went on the Zone diet, and I got back to a healthy size.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've really turned a corner in the past three or four years. It began when I decided to get back into acting, and to do that you need to look as good as you can—even if you're aging. There are a lot of wonderful actresses who are getting older and look fantastic. I want to be in that club. To me, aging gracefully is to let it happen and accept it. In my experience, fighting it always seems to backfire and make people look ridiculous. You see actresses get work done and it makes them unrecognizable. I look at these actresses like Diane Keaton, who has never had anything done, and I think that's cool. It's sexy, really.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'm taking good care of myself, with Pilates and yoga and a lot of chanting. I have good spiritual hygiene, and I use my NutriBullet and drink my juice and all that stuff. I've never felt better, and my self-esteem has grown a lot. I don't really care what other people think about me, because as long as I'm creating value and being positive about things, then what can anyone say? Even though I still eat cheese when I shouldn't, there's definitely been a shift.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I decided that I wanted to act again after I saw Sean Penn a few years ago in an independent film called This Must Be the Place [in which Penn plays a retired, middle-aged rock star]. I always think that if I were a guy, I would be Sean—he's like my male doppelgänger. But that film lit a fire in my belly. So I sat down with Sean and his agent, and they gave me a bunch of tasks, and I've checked every box over the past three years. I just became determined to claw my way up that greasy pole. The best way is to walk the line and be a good girl, and really focus on learning my craft more than I have in the past. I'm paying my dues, and it's been good for me.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Aging gracefully is to let it happen.

There was a time in 2006 when no designers I liked would dress me, so I started making my own clothes. I was getting everything off Etsy, and I looked kind of like Baby Jane Hudson—there were a lot of feathers. Then, in 2010, I tried what Karen Elson does with '20s clothes: I have a really cool collection of flapper dresses, and I was cutting them up and making my own outfits. They're beautiful, but they're just not right for me anymore. I mean, if I were 22, I would say, "Go all the way." They're more suitable for younger women. I still have them, and I shill them out to any chick playing rock music who is under a certain age.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It took me a long time to pay attention to fashion, but now I'm at a pretty conservative point in how I dress. I'm into ladylike clothes, like Victoria Beckham's—her dresses are flawless on me. And I love Michael Kors. He was the first designer who was really nice to me, the first one to give me free stuff. He taught me what taupe was, and nude. I still have this marigold sweater that he gave me in 1993. And you know who's been great to me through thick and thin and all of it? Marchesa. I love them and their team beyond words. They are so loyal. Sure, sometimes they're not going to give me a dress if they know Rihanna's going to wear it, but I accept that, and there's always something else that's good.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I also reconnected with Zac Posen recently, when he gave me an amazing gown to wear in a contemporary opera I did in New York in January called Kansas City Choir Boy. It's been a joy to have him in my life again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I went out on Oscar night this year, and it was like going back to high school and seeing old friends. There are some new kids, but when I see people like Leonardo DiCaprio or Mick Jagger or producers and directors, everyone's like, "Oh, God, Court! Hi! How are you?" It's like I haven't been gone at all. I met Natalie Portman, and she said, "I thought we were going to be best friends because I wore barrettes in high school, just like you!" And I was like, "Barrettes?!" I'd forgotten I did that back in the day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>This article originally appeared in the August 2015 issue of Harper's BAZAAR.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWFpg3h7wqisq6yemsZuuM6vnGZoaGaCcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-jesse-mccartneys-net-worth-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Jesse McCartney's Net Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cyberpunk-2077.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Apparition - Cyberpunk 2077 Iconic Weapon Location Guide | Cyberpunk 2077 Weapons Database</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
