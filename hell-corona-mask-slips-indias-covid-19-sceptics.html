Indian Independence Day this August saw anti-maskers calling for freedom from masks on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">social media</span></a>, and on October 2, some 200 anti-maskers took part in a protest at Mumbai’s Marine Drive. On November 1, protesters across India plan to demonstrate on what some call ‘mask-free day’.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of course, if asked to wear a mask while at a store or if they are passing a policeman, most anti-maskers may capitulate. In many states, people face fines of up to 1,000 rupees (US$13.50) for defying mask regulations. Enforcement has been stepped up especially in the hardest-hit states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/10/21/d805c558-134f-11eb-88e1-abf0a3fa7ebf_1320x770_153630.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra, the municipal government has fined over 14,000 people since April, while more than 25,000 people in Delhi have been fined since June.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet, according to a survey conducted by Apna Mask last month, only 44 per cent of people polled across 18 cities in India said they wore masks in public. This general non-compliance persists despite state governments having made this measure compulsory in some cities and states as early as April; even while the WHO was saying it wasn’t necessary and PPE was in short supply in parts of India.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Survey participants cited concerns including breathing issues and inconvenience, and expressed the belief that social distancing suffices as protection against Covid-19.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Indian super-spreaders drove rapid rise in coronavirus cases, researchers say</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the same time, some nine in 10 respondents in a survey of 15,000 people across India conducted last month by community social media platform LocalCircles said they approved of the mandatory use of masks in public areas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Conflicting surveys and attitudes may be attributed to Covid fatigue, uncertainty as well as concern about personal liberties. “The mask is a symbol of blind obedience and submission,” said Mugdha Pradhan, a 41-year-old nutritionist based in Pune.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It prevents me from connecting with other humans because I cannot gauge their facial expressions,” she said. “Above everything else, I own my body and I choose what I want to do with it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yohan Tengra, a 23-year-old research consultant and anti-masker based in Mumbai, challenges potential measures including mandatory Covid-19 testing and vaccination in the future. “Our movement isn’t just about masks,” Tengra said. “We had an amalgamation of issues … which mainly have to do with health and medical freedom.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/10/21/f84e2d28-1363-11eb-88e1-abf0a3fa7ebf_600x_153630.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His objections are rooted in a demand for better ‘policy-grade evidence’ – not easy given the race against time. “The burden of proof is on you, as you are making a positive claim that they actually died from Covid, so you have to show me evidence,” he contended. “We have also seen studies where risks went up because of wearing masks. The debate comes down to: is the risk worth the benefit?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The protester runs a website to connect with like-minded people. However, it remains on the fringe, and an Indian fact-checking site identified it as peddling conspiracy theories and Covid-19 misinformation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not everyone is going to open their mouth – literally or metaphorically – in the face of the unknown, at this point, but many are tempted to let their guard down.</p>The anti-maskers’ small but vocal protests come while India lingers at a crossroads. The country posted its lowest daily coronavirus caseload in nearly three months this week. But, health care experts have warned that infections could skyrocket again as India’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">high-octane holiday season</span></a> nears; celebrations for the Hindu festivals of Durga Puja and Diwali are due this month and in mid-November, respectively.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">India fears Diwali celebrations will bring surge in coronavirus</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most are trying to keep their exposure to essential activities, but some have no choice. Indians have also been anxious to return to work after a strict nationwide lockdown halted business activity for two months, leaving millions jobless and destitute almost overnight, especially those in the informal economy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No one wants to go back to that,” said Gargi Mukherjee, 42, as she shopped in the New Market area of Kolkata, which is thronging with festival-season customers – many without face masks. “For survival, people have to come out and do their jobs. If you don’t earn, you cannot feed your family,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sonali Dange, 29, who caught Covid-19 earlier this year, recently returned to work at a factory in Mumbai.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/10/08/afp_20201006183445.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:04</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">More children forced to work as coronavirus batters India’s economy</p><p>More children forced to work as coronavirus batters India’s economy</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mother of two daughters, she also has an elderly mother-in-law to look after.
