The televised court case was one of the most watched in US TV history, with more than 150 million people tuning in to see the not-guilty verdict, per The Hollywood Reporter.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was thanks to Simpson’s army of lawyers, commonly referred to as “the dream team”, that the NFL star walked free despite overwhelming evidence against him. Dershowitz was part of said dream team, and after OJ’s death on April 10 this year, the lawyer described his infamous former client as someone “the police tried to frame”, per the New York Post. Dershowitz added that he “got to know [OJ] fairly well during the trial” and commented, “I’m upset that he died.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2.

The two men became firm friends, with Epstein helping Dershowitz invest in a hedge fund, and Epstein funding a programme at Harvard, where Dershowitz taught, with the lawyer appointed faculty affiliate of the programme as part of the initiative, according to the same publication.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How are the Kardashians connected to OJ Simpson?

Dershowitz negotiated a “non-prosecution agreement”, resulting in Epstein serving 13 months in prison, but with six out of seven days spent in an office-based “work release” programme – meaning that, almost all of the time, he was not actually in prison. So lenient were the conditions of Epstein’s “incarceration” that he was even allowed to receive visits from a number of young women at his place of work, per The New Yorker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/15/44445ed2-0891-492b-9adc-f671cf509465_5c2340bc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dershowitz’s relationship with Epstein got more complicated after two of Epstein’s victims said they had sex with Dershowitz, who denied the allegations. Per The New Yorker, the lawyer said that Epstein was the only person he regretted representing, adding that he was misled about the severity of the allegations in 2005.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">3.

Dershowitz attempted to get the conviction overturned, saying that the sex had been consensual, but Washington was exploiting the situation for money and publicity. Tyson’s lawyer did not prevail, however.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">4.

Per The Harvard Crimson, the professor was retained to consult on “constitutional issues concerning certain email correspondence”. Weinstein was found guilty of multiple charges of rape and sexual assault, having been accused of such acts by more than 80 women. In March 2020, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Stephen Hawking’s controversial past and his Jeffrey Epstein link</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">5.
