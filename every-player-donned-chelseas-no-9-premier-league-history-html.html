He scored his first goal in April, ending a run of&nbsp;903 minutes without scoring for his new club... and it didn't get any better from there.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the 2011-12 season, he went on a 24-game barren run, eventually ending the season with six league goals. He got eight the year after, and five the year after that. Indeed, the damage was done, and he moved onto AC Milan on a two-year loan, with his career in tatters.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-29385d1a1d4461fc src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/12/8933596-6627689-image-m-68_1548334689820.jpg height=411 width=306 alt="Fernando Torres arrived for a huge fee, but was a huge flop during his time in west London" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-447d5cc1695a9031 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/12/8933594-6627689-image-a-69_1548334697957.jpg height=411 width=306 alt="Torres went on a 24-game barren run in the 2011-12 season" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Fernando Torres arrived for a huge fee, but was a huge flop during his time in west London</p>&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">Radamel Falcao (2015-2016)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After a season without a No 9, Falcao arrived on loan from Monaco with the potential to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.

Five Premier League goals this season isn't good enough, and there has been a real lack of trust in his ability from the manager.
