We were actually quite poor, and we came across a lot of these issues – should we buy stocks from other people?

Would Japanese audiences feel anything for this film?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After it showed, it felt like the response was quite passionate, so I let out a breath – just because it was a Taiwanese story, it didn’t mean that it couldn’t resonate with audiences. I hope it’s the same with Hong Kong – that it resonates with audiences.”</p>Want more articles like this?
