Collaborating with songwriter Fousheé, Gemini Rights tells the story of Lacy’s <a href=# rel=noopener>deteriorating relationships.</a> “This album is about so many perspectives of a breakup. I got to translate my personality into a record, which is what I’m super excited about: This is a conversation with me.” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">GQ.&nbsp;</a></p><p>When asked about “Bad Habit,” he&nbsp;<a href=# data-uri=ccea4676888edcd4e456d1fc60d5da09 rel=nofollow>told</a> the radio hosts Angela Yee and Charlamagne Tha God on The Breakfast Club, “I just felt it was a relatable story.” He later continued, “I’m shy, I’m really shy.” He later continued the story with <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> about how no one’s written a song like it before. “You know what’s funny about “Bad Habit” too? I was talking about this with a friend. It’s kind of also an underlying message of where I am in my life, like, ‘I wish I knew you wanted me.’ Take a fan or a listener, right? They want all these things from me, and I didn’t know. So I’m holding back from my true potential, because I just didn’t know.” He continued, “And it has to do with self-confidence, you know? But “Bad Habit” we found later on. We were talking about video concepts and stuff around this time. We were like, ‘Whoa, that’s actually wild. This actually relates to everything.’ It was kind of freaky.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a>, Lacy described the process of making the song. “It started out as this really clean, alternative rock song,” Lacy said. He also told the newspaper that he added the serrated hip-hop percussion as both a narrative exclamation point and an affirmation of his Blackness.</p><p>The single became a viral hit on TikTok and Lacy was known to troll his audience by letting them <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">sing the lyrics</a> by themselves when they only know the viral part. At one concert, Lacy interrupted the song and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">broke a fan’s disposable camera</a> on stage after an audience member threw it on stage, almost hitting Lacy. Lacy later apologized on Instagram, “maybe i couldve reacted better? sure. always. i’m a student of life. but i’m a real person with real feelings and real reactions. i’m not a product or a robot. i am human.”</p><p>On virality, he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">W Magazine</a>: “I love it. I want everybody to listen. It’s dope for everybody to interpret it in their own way. Am I gonna spend my energy being mad about my song doing well on TikTok? No, I’m not. I’ll spend my energy being grateful and working on more stuff.”</p><h2>Steve Lacy “Bad Habit” Lyrics</h2><p>Read Steve Lacy’s “Bad Habit” Lyrics below via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Genius.</a></p><p>[Intro: Steve Lacy &&nbsp;<i>Fousheé</i>]<br>I wish I knew you&nbsp;wanted me<br>I wish I knew<br>I wish I knew you wanted me<br>I wish I knew<br>I wish I knew you wanted me</p><p>[Verse 1: Steve Lacy]<br>What you, ooh, uh, what you do?<br>Madeamove,could’ve made amove<br>If I knewI’d be with you<br>Is it too late to pursue?</p><p>[Chorus: Steve Lacy]<br>I bite my tongue, it’s a bad habit<br>Kinda mad that I didn’t take a stab at it<br>Thought you were too good for me, my dear<br>Never gave me time of day, my dear<br>It’s okay, things happen for<br>Reasons that I think are sure, yeah</p><p>[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]<br>I wish I knew<br>I wish I knew you wanted me (I wish I knew)<br>I wish I knew (Oh)<br>I wish I knew you wanted me<br>I wish I knew (Yeah)<br>I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)<br>I wish I knew<br>I wish I knew you wanted me</p><p>[Verse 2: Steve Lacy]<br>Please say to me (Please, just say to me)<br>If you still want it<br>I wish you wouldn’t play with me<br>I wanna know (I wanna know)</p><p>[Chorus: Steve Lacy]<br>Can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?<br>Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?<br>No, you’re not too good for me, my dear<br>Funny you come back to me, my dear<br>It’s okay, things happen for<br>Reasons that I can’t ignore, yeah</p><p>[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]<br>I wish I knew<br>I wish I knew you wanted me<br>I wish I knew (Wish I knew)<br>I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)</p><p>[Bridge: Steve Lacy]<br>You can’t surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)<br>I’m everywhere, I’m cross-eyed, and (I wish I knew you wanted me)<br>Now that you’re back, I can’t decide (I wish I knew)<br>If I decide if you’re invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)<br>You always knew the way to wow me<br>Fuck around, get tongue-tied, and<br>I turn it on, I make it rowdy<br>Then carry on, but I’m not hidin’<br>You grabbin’ me hard ’cause you know what you found<br>It’s biscuits, it’s gravy, babe</p><p>[Instrumental Break]</p><p>[Outro: Steve Lacy, Steve Lacy & Fousheé]<br>You can’t surprise a Gemini<br>But you know it’s biscuits, it’s gravy, babe<br>I knew you’d come back around<br>‘Cause you know it’s biscuits, it’s gravy, babe<br>Let’s fuck in the back of the mall, lose control<br>Go stupid, go crazy, babe<br>I know I’ll be in your heart ’til the end<br>You’ll miss me, don’t beg me, babe</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/steve-lacy-gemini-rights.jpg><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
