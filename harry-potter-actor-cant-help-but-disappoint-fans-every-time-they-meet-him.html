The <a href=#>celebrity</a> made the confession when sitting on the sofa with Kelly Clarkson on her talk show.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniel-radcliffe-can-t-help-disappointing-fans-with-his-age>Daniel Radcliffe can’t help disappointing fans with his age</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1512210-1024x687.jpg><p>During the hilarious segment, the Now You See Me 2 actor said there’s a negative reaction from his loyal fans when they finally get to make their wildest dreams come true and meet him.</p><p><a href=#>Music</a> star Kelly had confessed that she broke “the wall” for her kids. The mom explained they had watched a movie she starred in, UglyDolls and couldn’t understand how she was on-screen but also there in real life. Kelly had no other choice but to explain characters were real people.</p><p>She then devastated her kids by saying Elsa in Frozen was real too. We all know the incredible vocal ability from the Disney film comes from Idina Menzel, but her children didn’t.</p><p>That’s when Daniel Radcliffe chimed in – but it was his age that was the issue.</p><p>The 34-year-old, who last appeared in the <a href=#>Harry Potter</a> franchise more than 10 years ago, says fans come to a sudden realization when they see him. Even younger generations, who have just seen the films, can’t comprehend how he’s not a teenager anymore. He went further to say he spoils the magic for kids “on a regular basis”.</p><p>He still gets spotted in public though, so Daniel Radcliffe’s age can’t be much of an issue right now.</p><p>“I’m like, I’m sorry,” he said. “They’re like, ‘You’re old now! What happened?'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-breaking-the-mold-for-hollywood>Breaking the mold for Hollywood</h2><p>It can be tough for any actor who has done a long series of films to be seen as a new character. Daniel Radcliffe, who was at the young age of 11 when the first Harry Potter arrived, spent 13 years playing The Boy Who Lived.</p><p>Fans ended up watching him and his co-stars <a href=#>Emma Watson</a>, Rupert Grint, grow up in the eight movies. Despite the first flick coming out in 2001, more than 20 years ago, fans apparently still have an issue he’s growing up.</p><p>But he’s been in many other successful films and <a href=#>TV</a> shows since. Daniel has been a part of The Lost City, Kill Your Darlings, Victor Frankenstein and Weird: The Al Yankovic Story.</p><p>The actor just welcomed his first child with his partner, Erin Darke in April this year.</p><p>The parents became parents for the first time, which is something Daniel is enjoying.</p><p>He recently said on embracing fatherhood: “It’s awesome… I’ve kind of really enjoyed the first six months. I don’t know what I imagined, honestly, but it’s great. He’s incredible, and I’m just, like, in awe.”</p><p>The star recently had to come clean on whether he’s ripped abs were in <a href=#>preparation of becoming the next Wolverine</a>. Fans had assumed he was getting buff to take over the role from <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> in a reboot.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WAcLTAq6myZaCkwbWx0WaYnKyfp3qkrc2tZKGdnKV6o8HTZpuiq5GlvbC1za1kn5meqHqmwsSrsGasmaKybsDHnrBmpZWawW60yKZm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jamie-yuccas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jamie Yuccas - Bio, Age, Career, Nationality, Facts, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dave-and-jenny-marrs-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dave and Jenny Marrs Incredible Love Life and 5 Beautiful Children</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
