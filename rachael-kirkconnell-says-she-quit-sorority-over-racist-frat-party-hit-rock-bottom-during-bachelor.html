"If I had to think about it at the time, I was probably just thinking, 'OK, just some super traditional fraternity and they probably just want to continue the tradition of what they used to wear when the fraternity was founded.'"</p><p>"And so, when I first learned that it was [racist], I was really ashamed that I unknowingly participated in that and basically continued that tradition," she continued. "Between that and just a lot of other things about Greek life, I was like, 'I don't want to be part of this anymore.' So I dropped out after that."</p><p>"And I guess that's the first time my eyes opened [up] about a difference between being not racist and anti-racist."</p><p>She also recalled how she was told to stay silent as the controversy began making headlines. "I had a lot of people in my ear saying, 'You'll have your time. Don't make it worse. You'll have your time to speak. We'll give you a platform. Just wait it out."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ff91e55f-8dc7-447f-9b8c-e42dc9d214be data-container-ref=toofab:article:89b8e34a-9fd9-41c7-9dac-90e4b4daa1f7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/5by4/2021/08/31/dc4e3c4433b54e31aeee7259cc47edde_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bachelor's Kelley Flanagan Breaks Down in Tears As She Reveals Lyme Disease Diagnosis</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>After finally speaking out, however, the backlash continued because her Instagram post was only a statement and not a conversation, according to Rachael. "Anyone could have written that statement, which a lot of people had thought," she added. "I didn't even have any sort of representation at that point. People were like, ‘Wow, her publicist did great with this.' That's when I was like, it's not enough."</p><p>Around this time, she broke up with "Bachelor" Matt James and said she hit "rock bottom," so she decided to share an Instagram Live video speaking on her accountability.</p><p>"I wanted to apologize and for some people, that won't be enough and I completely understand that," she said. "People are more than entitled not to forgive me, but that was my rock bottom. I had lost everything."</p><p>The couple have since reunited and Rachael said she is trying to look at the situation in a positive light.</p><p>"Matt and I are in a great place now and I've grown so much from the entire experience," she said. "I've learned so much and I try and tell myself, 'Well, you do have this platform now that you can make a difference with.'"</p><a id=gallery-link-8e6ac63f-8a61-4777-b41b-7ec910bf9771 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8e6ac63f-8a61-4777-b41b-7ec910bf9771 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:89b8e34a-9fd9-41c7-9dac-90e4b4daa1f7 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c2/4by3/2021/09/01/c24f18d605a44bd985339ef07ba9e9b0_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3JmaWpfp66ktMCeo2ajmae4pLvNp5ylpF2orrq%2FjKyfnmWhqra1edKoqaiqmanGbrvVnqlmqpGYtrTAjJ%2Bpmqxdpa6zwNhmn6KsXae8pLeMm6atrJ%2BieqXB0aKloGWSlrCpscuoqWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rex-ryan-gets-breakup-tattoo-ex-jets-coach-inking-wife-green-new-york-jersey-changed-bills-blue-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rex Ryan gets his own breakup tatto</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicoline-yiki-biography-age-family-images-net-worth-tellygupshup.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicoline Yiki Biography, Age, Family, Images, Net Worth Tellygupshup</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
