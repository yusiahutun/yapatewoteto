D'Amelio, the most followed person on TikTok, also lamented not hitting the 100 million follower milestone in a year.</p><p>"Ugh, I just wish I had more time because imagine if I hit 100 mil one year after hitting a mil," she exclaimed. Charles, who was the "mystery guest" at the dinner, cracked, "95 million not enough for you?"</p><p>Shortly after, a massive unfollowing occurred for D'Amelio, who attempted to bandage the hemorrhaging by sharing several tearful TikTok apologies.</p><p>"this charli situation is NOT sitting right with me..." Charles <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. "100M followers in one year & y'all expect her to know how to be a perfect role model? death threats because she's a picky eater & made a joke about a milestone? 30+ year olds dragging someone half their age? feels familiar."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Definitely have always said no one deserves to be cancelled.

It's unbecoming." She also turned her attention to Charles, 21, calling him "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">predatory</a>"<strong> </strong>for being pals<strong> </strong>with D'Amelio, 16, and asking for him to be "cancelled."</p><p>"Definitely have always said no one deserves to be cancelled," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.

"I became friends with the D'Amelio family as a whole very, very early on because this was all very, very new to them and I wanted to be a friend and a mentor in any way that I possibly could. And Charli and I, despite not being the same age, had one thing in common, which is coming into the spotlight at a very, very young age."</p><p>Charles then came for Paytas', saying, "This is something that Trisha has never experienced because the only reason she is in the spotlight is because she has said racist things, she has said the N-word, she's done <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blackface</a>, she offended the trans community, she offended the DID community, she said Hitler wasn't that bad of a guy, voted for Trump, and has started a fight with about every single other creator on this platform."</p><p>Many of Charles' claims about Paytas have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on</a>, although she previously said she voted for Joe Biden.</p><p>"You are in no position to be talking about me and my career," Charles continued. "So I highly recommend that you stop starting fights with people that are half your age, pack it up, and work on holding yourself and your best friends around you, because they and you are the problem," he added.</p><p>TooFab has reached out to Charles, D'Amelio and Paytas for comment.</p><a id=gallery-link-9de81d71-ad4e-4c7a-8fd2-6c87dbda6a8f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9de81d71-ad4e-4c7a-8fd2-6c87dbda6a8f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:0bc6f2e5-5882-456c-b68d-c922ef1d8090 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/08/4by3/2020/11/16/082b7929439049b9b06ddfc518ce34d4_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7kGpma2hfn66usdJmmqGZoqGytHnHoqusZZKWsKx5wK1knKCRp7mqecOapJ6kmaR6qa3TnqmsZaOhrq6%2FjK2poquYlnqxrditmKxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennie-garth-net-worth-kids.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennie Garth Wiki, Age, Net Worth 2022, Salary, Husband, Kids, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./exmouth-town-fc-16-football-club-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Exmouth Town FC: 16 Football Club Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
