Over the years, he painted a picture of destiny that inspired his congregation instead of frightening them. One of Kim Clement prophecies on <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> came to pass.</p><p class=align-left>In 2007, he prophesied that Donald Trump would become president. There is no further information about this. However, you can get to know more by listening to some of his sermons at the Church of Christ.</p><p class=align-left>How accurate was Kim Clement? The pastor has received appraisals and criticisms in equal measures. On July 25th, 1996, he gave <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a prophecy in Detroit</a> that did not make much sense at the time. However, a little more than five years later, the message predicting America's attack by terrorists flying over Long Island became painfully clear.</p><p class=align-left>On June 24th, 2010, Kim paged <a id=https://www.nibiruplanetx.info/kim-clement/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a brief paragraph</a> on his prophecies.

"Kim, are you ever wrong?" Yes, I am… Some of my prophet compatriots have taken it upon themselves to tear this apart and say, "well, he wasn't that correct. He said many things that didn't come to pass." So did you. I made mistakes, and so did you.<p class=align-left>As a prophet who enjoyed a massive following, Kim Clement's last words were shared over and over again on various social media platforms after his death. Especially his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">final prophetic words</a> on North Korea, Iran, and the United States.</p><h3 id=406640-who-are-kim-clement-wife-and-children class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Who are Kim Clement wife and children?</h3><p class=align-left>He met his wife Jane Elizabeth Barnes in 1978, and they tied the knot the same year.
