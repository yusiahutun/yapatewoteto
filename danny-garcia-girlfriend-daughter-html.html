Since debuting against Mike Denby on November 17. 2007, the professional boxer held the lineal light-welterweight titles from 2012 to 2015.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>To top it off, he even won the&nbsp;WBC welterweight title in 2016. Given his undeniable success in his career spanning 14 years, Garcia has undoubtedly lived the best life in the world in the boxing realm.&nbsp;</p><p>And his personal life is also no less. He is enjoying parenthood with his long-time girlfriend, Erica Mendez. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Danny Garcia and Girlfriend Welcomed Daughter in 2015</h2><p>It's uncertain when Garcia and Mendez started dating, but it is safe to say that they have been together since 2015. The long-time partners welcomed their first child —&nbsp;daughter, Philly Swift Gracia (6) —&nbsp;on August 15, 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Mendez shared the details of her daughter's birth and her pregnancy through her Instagram posts.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>"My baby girl was born at 6:03 AM this morning," she announced in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one update</a> after her daughter's birth. The new mother clarified she had a troublesome time delivering the baby girl, for she had to be in labor for 47 long hours.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per her accounts, she and her partner had decided to have their child through home birth. But as the condition didn't progress even after 24 hours of labor, they finally went to the hospital, following their midwife's advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mendez tolerated the labor for 23 more hours in the hospital. After that, however, the situation only degraded as she suffered from preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that affects other body organs such as kidneys and liver because of high blood pressure.</p><p>Considering the complications, doctors advised her to have a&nbsp;C-section procedure, and Mendez obliged, although she wanted a normal birth.&nbsp;In the Instagram post, she mentioned she had to what was best for her and her family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mendez also shared that her daughter was&nbsp;perfectly healthy and beautiful. "It's so weird looking at her because she looks just like me," she added at the end of the lengthy write-up.</p><h2>About Danny Garcia's Girlfriend&nbsp;Erica Mendez</h2><p>Garcia's wife-like partner is an aspiring entertainer and a singer. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Heavy</a>, Mendez&nbsp;started singing at an early age and won many regional vocal competitions.</p><p>Following her passion, she studied classical music at The Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts and later attended East Stroudsburg University to be an opera singer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Philadelphia native created her interpretation of the&nbsp;National Anthem and sang it to&nbsp;16,000 people during an opening of a&nbsp;boxing competition at&nbsp;Brooklyn's Barclay Center in 2012. She also sang&nbsp;The Star-Spangled Banner at a Philadelphia Phillies game in front of 44,000 fans.</p><p>And that isn't all. Mendez landed opening gigs for musical artists like&nbsp;Aretha Franklin,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Arcangel</a>, Tonio Rosario, Aventura,&nbsp;Tego Calderon, Michael Stuart, and <a href=# rel=follow>Alicia Keys</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides being a singer, Garcia is also a model and a fashionista.

She is only six as of this time of writing, but she has already stepped foot into modeling.</p><p>The young Gracia has modeled for Nova Kids,&nbsp;FashionNova's&nbsp;clothing collection for&nbsp;kids. And as apparent in her parent's Instagram, Philly also models for her family's clothing store,&nbsp;DSG.&nbsp;</p><p>Without question, the 6-year-old has made her parents proud.</p><p>Mendez even shared her pride in having Philly as her daughter through an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram post</a> dated April 24, 2020.&nbsp;She stated she had the best daughter in the world and reiterated that she loved her very much. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRo7u6ecaaqZyhkWK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZeqWt1KCfrZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-lambert-we-should-be-friends.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Lambert, 'We Should Be Friends' [Listen]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-alan-shelton-dead.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bluegrass Guitarist James Alan Shelton Dead at 53</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
