One of their latest controversies nearly tore the couple apart and marked the end of the union.</p><p>It involved a fallout resulting from a sexual assault scandal that engulfed Noth in December 2021. At the time, two women, identified as Zoe and Lily, came forward with claims that the actor sexually assaulted them in 2004 and 2015 respectively.</p><p>The claims followed Noth’s appearance in the “Sex and the City” reboot, “And Just Like That…” where he reprised the role of Mr Big. Although the actor immediately denied these claims, his “SATC” co-stars backed the alleged assault victims, especially after two more women brought forth similar allegations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Our-Favorite-Hollywood-Multicultural-Couples-Page-5.jpeg><p>Ultimately, Noth’s career took a downturn. He got ousted from several projects, including his role in “The Equalizer.” Expectedly, such negative publicity took a huge hit on his marriage.</p><p>In January 2022 news outlets reported that Tara Wilson, the wife of Chris Noth, was <a href=#>spotted having a breakdown</a> while sitting in her car in Los Angeles. Photos showed the devastated woman wiping tears from her face, partly hidden by a pair of massive glasses.</p><p>Many immediately linked this moment to the impact of the sex scandal on her marriage. Sources claimed Noth and his wife were on the verge of a breakup, further proven by the absence of a wedding band on Wilson’s fingers.</p><p>Somehow, the couple reconciled their differences and decided to keep their marriage intact. The couple has since remained strong in love, braving the aftermath of Noth’s infidelities and resulting abuse claims.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Chris_Noths_Wife_Tara_Wilson></span><strong>Who Is Chris Noth’s Wife Tara Wilson?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chris Noth’s wife <a href=#>Tara Lynn Wilson</a> is a Canadian actress, who obtained her degree from the American University of Dramatic arts.</p><p>Born in 1979, in British Columbia, Canada, the star moved to New York City to pursue a career in acting.

Sources would later confirm this, with one revealing Chris Noth and Tara Wilson’s marriage was hanging by a thread.</p><p>Per the source, the writer was upset, and only wanted to protect her children, something she considered her number one priority. After a series of dramatic sightings, the couple eventually sorted things out, evident in their joint red carpet appearance since then, and Noth’s support for his wife’s stage play, “B.R.O.K.E.N,” back in June 2022.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_She_Has_Two_Children></span><strong>5.
