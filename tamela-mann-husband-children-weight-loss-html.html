We wanted a fairytale wedding, so we picked an enchanted forest theme and hosted everyone at the Joule Hotel because it had the feel we were trying to create — old-world romantic, beautiful, chic and lush — and a place everyone would love. Our grandbabies were dressed as little princes and princesses.”</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>However, there was one surprise at the wedding, and it has continued ever since.

She further explained her motivation behind the weight loss and the details regarding it,</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>“One of the main struggles [of breaking into the industry] was my weight! I’ve always been good enough to be heard but not seen. I’ve lost over 140 pounds, I used to be a 30/32 and now I’m at an 18/20. I don’t have issues with diabetes or hypertension, but I don’t want it to happen.”</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Hence, with a healthy lifestyle, Tamella along with her husband continue to enjoy their married life and the beautiful family.
