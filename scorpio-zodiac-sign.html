The water sign is associated with a need to seek power and emanate intensity, reverence for elders and family, a willingness to swim in the depth of emotion, and perseverance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These traits are owed to Scorpio's co-ruling planets — yes, there are two: Mars, the planet of action, sex, strength, and courage, and Pluto, the planet of transformation, the underworld, life, death, and rebirth. A few dedicated, magnetic,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>power-commanding Scorpios</a>&nbsp;include Amandla Stenberg, Katy Perry, Ciara, Gabrielle Union, Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway, and Shailene Woodley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about the dynamic, private powerhouse water sign.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scorpio-personality-traits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scorpio Personality Traits</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Magnetic Go-Getter of the Zodiac</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typical sun in Scorpio traits include being extremely private, even secretive, about subjects they consider near and dear to their hearts and being intensely sexual (whether or not they're willing to open up about that side of them). Scorpios are driven but locked into their belief systems. They have an eye toward world domination in a quiet, cunning way and are fiercely magnetic, managing to command the spotlight. Scorpios also tend to be comfortable with the darker side of life and death and are capable of wading in big emotions and deep-rooted psychology.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Fixed Water Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every sign is assigned a quality (cardinal, mutable, or fixed), which explains the sign's basic energy. There's a cardinal, mutable, and fixed sign within every element (fire, earth, air, water). Scorpio is the fixed one of the water group, meaning they're just as stubborn as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taurus</a>&nbsp;(earth), as well as&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Aquarius</a>&nbsp;(air) and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Leo</a> (fire) — but also rock-steady and achievement-oriented. They naturally get locked into a set pattern of behavior or perspective, which means it can be challenging for them to redirect.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpios' Best Personality Traits</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spiritual, wise, and enchanting, you can guarantee that the Scorpios in your life will inspire and empower you to pinpoint and live your truth. They are the politicians of the zodiac — more U.S. presidents have been Scorps, or Aquarians, than any other sign. They appear fearless and even a bit prickly at times, which can be perceived as intimidating, but it's a veneer. Scorpios simply need to warm up and trust you to open their hearts. Once they do, they'll be connected with you for life, as far as they're concerned. (Remember that fixed nature.) They're deeply heartfelt and romantic, expressing how they feel in a poetic way.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpios' Worst Personality Traits</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scorpios zero in on their desires and needs. This can get out of bounds at times, leading to unhealthy infatuations, obsessions, and even paranoia. Because they're wired to understand the underbelly of life — thanks to their co-ruler Pluto — they might also tend to see the dark side of any situation, leading to pessimism. The key is for them to balance their intense emotions and drive with a healthy dose of pragmatism. For signs who are a bit more outspoken, tending to wear their hearts on their sleeves (looking at you,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fire signs</a>), Scorpio's cool, detached, mysterious shtick might prove frustrating.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scorpios-in-love-and-lust></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scorpios in Love and Lust</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio's Romance Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The water sign is a mover and shaker who has no shame in getting lost in their feelings (it's no surprise Drake is a Scorp). This is perfect for anyone who's ready to sign up for a downright transformative romance. Loving a Scorpio means loving their lifelong exploration of the depths of emotions and life — and whatever comes after it. They also tend to be innately intensely sexual, so even if you're at the innocent start of a relationship, their physical magnetism can lead to spark-inducing tension.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio's Sexual Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given their associations with the Eighth House and Mars, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>both rule sex</a>, Scorpios can't help but be passionate — and crave experiences that allow them to express that passion physically. They live for the moments in which physicality and spirituality intersect, which can often lead to personal and/or relationship growth. Scorps are naturally intrigued by sexual expression and exploration, so they might experiment with a bevy of fetishes or desires. They tend to be fairly shameless in expressing said desires. Scorpions see the merit of sex for sex's sake but will be one of the first signs to admit that a loving bond and attachment takes any physical encounter to the next level.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scorpio-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scorpio Compatibility</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Most Compatible Signs</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Signs that share the same element tend to be the most in sync (e.g. two&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>earth signs</a>, like Taurus and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Capricorn</a>). This is especially the case for two water signs, both of whom lead with their emotions. Water is also traditionally compatible with earth because the two elements complement one another. The two elements share certain attributes, like being loyal, service-oriented, and invested in nurturing their home life. That said, a Scorpio often sparks with a fellow family-oriented, emotional&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Cancer</a>, empathetic&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Pisces</a>, or similarly driven Capricorn.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Least Compatible Signs</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Opposites can attract — and Scorpio and Taurus often connect on their shared desire to dig their heels in and build something purposeful and lasting. However, two hard-headed, fixed signs might also clash if a compromise is out of the question. Scorpio doesn't tend to pair well with charismatic fire sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leo</a>&nbsp;or futurist air sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Aquarius</a>. Unless they have other positive aspects in their natal charts, Scorpio can respect these two other fixed signs for their ability to pinpoint an objective and see it through. Emotionally, though, they're each too set in their own habits and perspectives.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scorpio-elsewhere-in-your-chart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scorpio Elsewhere in Your Chart</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sun sign is one of many aspects of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natal chart</a>. When you were born, the moon and all the planets in our solar system were in one of the 12 signs and a particular position — all of which help to inform your personality and areas of your life. Here's what it means if Scorpio shows up in any of the main areas of your chart:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio Moon</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moon, which spends about two to three days in each sign, influences your emotions and intuition. If it was in Scorpio at the time of your birth, your feelings tend to be a wholely intense experience. And when you find someone or something you care about, you set your sights on forging a lasting bond.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio Mercury</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mercury, which spends about two to three weeks in a sign, shapes your communication style. If it was in Scorpio when you were born, you're intellectually fired up to dive into deep, sometimes even taboo, topics that others shy away from. You care about getting to the core of any subject at hand and exploring it in a thoroughly investigative, perhaps even suspicious way. They tend to be natural professors and politicians.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio Venus</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Venus, which remains in a sign for about three to five weeks, influences how you behave in relationships and how you attract others. If you were born with the planet of love and beauty in Scorpio, you don't shy away from intense feelings, commitment, or intimacy. You're open to romance and love being an all-encompassing, extremely emotional experience.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio Mars</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mars, which remains in a sign for six or seven weeks, affects your energy, strength, sexual style, and how you experience courage. If you were born while the fiery, dynamic, fighter planet was in fixed, watery Scorpio, it's right at home, as Mars is one of the co-rulers of Scorpio. You're dynamic, action-oriented, and challenge-seeking, interested in setting a bar for yourself, hitting it, and even pushing past it whenever possible.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio Ascendant (or Rising)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ascendant or rising sign</a>&nbsp;influences how you present yourself to the world. As a Scorpio ascendant, you come off as charismatic, intense, charming, and mysterious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9KcpquomaR6u7vDopicZaOetK8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-soho.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jessica Soho dating?
