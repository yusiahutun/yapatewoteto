That meant that each individual PCI port and its installed cards could take full advantage of their maximum speed, without multiple cards or expansions being clogged up in a single bus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5994b599c6380.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In layman's terms, imagine your desktop PC as a&nbsp;restaurant. The old PCI standard was like a deli, everyone waiting in a single line to get served, with the speed of service limited by a single person at the counter. PCI-E is more like a bar, every patron sitting down in an assigned seat, with multiple bartenders taking everyone's order at once. (Okay, so it's never possible to get a bartender to every patron right away, but let's pretend this is a really great bar.) With dedicated data lanes for each expansion card or peripheral, the entire computer can access components and accessories faster.</p><p>Now to extend our deli/bar metaphor, imagine that some of those seats have multiple bartenders reserved just for them. That's where the idea of multiple lanes comes in.</p><h2 id=life-in-the-fast-lanes>Life in the Fast Lanes</h2><p>PCI-E has gone through multiple revisions since its inception; currently new motherboards generally use version 3 of the standard, with the faster version 4 becoming more and more common and version 5 expected to hit in 2019. But&nbsp;the different revisions all use the same physical connections, and those connections can come in four primary sizes: x1, x4, x8, and x16. (x32 ports exist, but are extremely rare and generally not seen on consumer hardware.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fixed.png><p>The different physical sizes allow for different numbers of simultaneous data pin connections to the motherboard: the larger the port, the more maximum connections on the card and the port. These connections are colloquially known as "lanes," with each PCI-E lane comprised of two signaling pairs, one for sending data and the other for receiving data. Different revisions of the PCI-E standard allow for different speeds on each lane. But generally speaking, the more lanes there are on a single PCI-E port and its connected card, the faster data can flow between the peripheral and the rest of the computer system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Going back to our bar metaphor: if you imagine each patron sitting at the bar as a PCI-E device, then an x1 lane would be a single bartender serving a single customer. But a patron sitting in the assigned "x4" seat would have&nbsp;four&nbsp;bartenders fetching him drinks and food, and the "x8" seat would have eight bartenders just for her drinks, and the one in the "x16" seat would have a whopping sixteen bartenders just for him. And now we're going to stop talking about bars and bartenders, because our poor metaphorical drinkers are in danger of alcohol poisoning.</p><h2 id=what-peripherals-use-which-ports>What Peripherals Use Which Ports?</h2><p>For the common revision 3.0 version of PCI Express, the maximum per-lane data rate is eight gigatransfers, a term that means "all the data and electronic overhead at once." In the real world, the speed for PCI-E revision 3 is a little less than one gigabyte per second, per lane.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Now a Good Time to Buy a New NVIDIA or AMD Graphics Card?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So a device that uses a PCI-E x1 port, like a low-power sound card or a Wi-Fi antenna, can transfer data to the rest of the computer at approximately 1GBps. A card that bumps up to the physically larger x4 or x8 slot, like a USB 3.0 expansion card, can transfer data four or eight times faster---and it would need to, if more than two of those USB ports were being used at their maximum transfer rate. The PCI-E x16 ports, with a theoretical maximum of around 15GBps on the 3.0 revision, are used for almost all <a href=#>modern graphics cards designed by NVIDIA and AMD</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5994aef6aed90.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is the M.2 Expansion Slot, and How Can I Use It?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There aren't any set guidelines for which expansion cards will use which number of lanes. Graphics cards tend to use x16 just for the sake of maximum data transfer, but obviously you don't need a network card to use an x16 port and sixteen full lanes when its Ethernet port is only capable of transferring data at one gigabit per second (about an eighth of the throughput of one PCI-E lane---remember, eight bits to a byte). There are a small amount of PCI-E mounted solid state drives that prefer an x4 port, but those seem to have been swiftly overtaken by <a href=#>the new M.2 standard, which can also use the PCI-E bus</a>.&nbsp;High-end network cards and enthusiast equipment like adapters and RAID controllers use a mix of x4 and x8 formats.</p><h2 id=remember-pci-e-port-size-and-lanes-may-not-be-the-same-thing>Remember: PCI-E Port Size and Lanes May Not Be the Same Thing</h2><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is a "Chipset", and Why Should I Care?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's one of the more confusing parts of the PCI-E setup: a port might be the size of an x16 card, but only have enough data lanes for something much less speedy, like x4. This is because while PCI-E can accommodate basically unlimited amounts of individual connections, there's still a practical limit on the lane throughput of the chipset. Cheaper motherboards with more budget-oriented chipsets might only go up to a single x8 slot, even if that slot can physically accommodate an x16 card. Meanwhile, "gamer" motherboards will include up to four full x16-size and x16-lane PCI-E slots for maximum GPU compatibility. (We've discuss this in more detail <a href=#>here</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5994a79d22399.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Obviously, this can cause problems. If your motherboard has two x16-sized slots, but one of them has only x4 lanes, then plugging your fancy new graphics card into the wrong slot could bottleneck its performance by 75%. That's a theoretical result, of course: the architecture of motherboards means you won't see such a dramatic decline. The point is, the right card needs to go in the right slot.</p><p>Luckily, the lane capacity of the specific PCI-slots is generally spelled out in the computer or motherboard manual, with an illustration of which slot has which capacity. If you don't have your manual, the number of lanes is generally written on the PCB of the motherboard next to the port, like so:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5994aa5bbbdca.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, a shorter x1 or x4 card can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">physically fit into a longer x8 or x16 slot</a>: the initial pin configuration of the electrical contacts makes it compatible. The card may be a bit loose physically, but when screwed into place in the expansion slots of a PC case, it's more than adequately sturdy. Naturally, if a card's contacts are physically larger than the slot, it can't be inserted.</p><p>So remember, when buying expansion or upgrade cards for PCI Express slots, you need to be mindful of both the size and the lane rating of your available ports.</p><p>Image credit: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Newegg</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Amazon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqa2phbYZww8eyZJqqlWLBqbGMqZqiZZWtvbOx0qxkqaeiqcBuu81mpLJlnaTBqbHRm6aaqpRisaqyxZ6pnqakYsCqxsSsZLFpZmLFeXnXbWSappRixXJ5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./flavor-flav-married-wife-girlfriend-kids-now-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Flavor Flav Is Getting the Sweet Taste Out of Married Life?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./snapchat-enters-augmented-reality-partnership-with-live-nation-for-live-concerts-and-festivals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Snapchat Enters Augmented Reality Partnership with Live Nation For Concerts and Festivals</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
