After joining Aidensfield police from London, Nick's character, PC Nick Rowan (later sergeant Rowan),&nbsp;initially received hostility from his fellow staff but then eventually became a much-loved member of the community.</p><p id=eMz5BfOfUrKS data-wc=84>PC Nick was married to Dr Kate Rowan, and the two had a daughter named Sarah but sadly his wife then lost her battle with leukaemia. The officer then married Jo, a school teacher, and was promoted to sergeant, before deciding to leave Aidensfield and join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Nick's departure formed the storyline to one-off special, . <strong>Fun fact: Nick Berry also performed the theme tune to the police drama, which is a cover of Buddy Holly track Heartbeat.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/629a59d9da2a-nick-berry-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eNiQ19H12smQ data-wc=7><strong>Nick left to focus on family life</strong></p><h2>Why did Nick Berry leave Heartbeat?</h2><p id=eZyty52N-NhS data-wc=71><strong>Nick decided to leave Heartbeat to focus on his family life.</strong> He and he wife, actress Rachel Robertson, married in 1994 and welcomed their first child, a son, a year later named Louis.

"I chose to be a stay-at-home dad and have loved it," he explained.<strong> "I always said that when the boys were teenagers I could go back, but the longer you don't do something the harder it is to do it, and I haven't really missed it</strong>. While I'd never say never, I'm genuinely happy as I am."</p><h2>Where is Nick Berry now?</h2><p id=e-0AUVV12sCK data-wc=55>It seems the actor continues to live a quiet life away from TV acting. His most recent role was in 2012 when he made an appearance as the character Simon Wicks in EastEnders. A<strong>fter that, he set up his own production company which he ran until 2019. He and his family live in Epping, Essex.</strong></p><p id=ezheG-XtQCz5 data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2toYG1%2FcYWUcGxwZ6edsrOxjKKqZqCVlr%2B1rsSaq2arpJa%2FbrrInKJmmpWnv7p5wKebZq%2BYrnqltcNmn55lnJqut7GMrJ%2Bor18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wind-breaker-anime-episode-1-release-date-how-to-watch-expected-plot-and-more-1292048.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wind Breaker Anime Episode 1: Release Date, How To Watch, Expected Plot And More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sri-lankas-tea-country-good-bad-and-ugly-sides.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sri Lankas tea country: the good, bad and ugly sides to the plantations of Ceylon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
