In 2002, when internet crime blogs were virtually nonexistent, Allore created the website, 'Who Killed Theresa?'<i> </i>and dove headlong into solving the mystery that haunted his family for years.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After a brief, botched police investigation, Theresa's case went cold until 2001 when Allore launched his own&nbsp;post-mortem inquiry into her devastating death, which he documented tirelessly on his website.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His investigation - which was marked by many twists, turns, roadblocks, corruption, fallouts with police, and a suspected cover-up - eventually led him to a convicted rapist and murderer named Luc Yolande Gregoire.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the process, Allore reconnected with his high school girlfriend, Patricia Pearson, who had since gone on to become a famous crime writer, and together they detailed his decades-long research in the <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>book</a>, 'Wish You Were Here,' released this earlier this month in the US.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the biggest bombshell had yet to come: a deathbed confessional from a local criminal with a long rap sheet, named Regis Lachance - sending Allore back down the rabbit hole to square one: Who really killed Theresa Allore?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the fall of 1978, the 19-year-old straight-A student went missing from her dorm room at Champlain College in Quebec. She wasn't seen again until five months later, when the spring thaw revealed her semi-nude body, lying face down in ten inches of marshy backwash. The coroner observed&nbsp;strangulation marks around her neck, but strangely omitted that detail from his final report.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cops immediately dismissed her death as a drug related, despite toxicology indicating that there was no trace of drugs or alcohol in her system. 'People who overdose aren't found naked, lying facedown in a water ditch,' said Allore. 'My sister was murdered.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So began, one loving, thoughtful family's descent into a living nightmare.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now almost 45 years later, Allore, 58, is the father of three daughters, living in North Carolina and working as the budget director for the city of Durham.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He admits that he didn't think much about his sister's death in the years interim, 'We tried to operate as best we could as if nothing had changed and didn't really realize we were doing a fairly crappy job at it,' he tells DailyMail.com.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But in 2001, 23 years after Theresa's disappearance, a knock on his front door brought it all back. Local police in his small North Carolina suburb were investigating the murder of a young girl that they suspected was buried under his house.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I figured,&nbsp;if this Podunk police force can go to that level of effort, what the hell is wrong with the Quebec police?' Thus prompted Allore's obsessive 20-year-long quest for answers in the unsolved murder of his sister.</p><img id=i-f7a27cfef0ac0b2b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/07/00/57414547-10783163-Theresa_Allore_19_mysteriously_vanished_from_her_dormitory_at_Ch-a-228_1654558306009.jpg height=779 width=962 alt="Theresa Allore, 19, mysteriously vanished from her dormitory at Champlain College in Quebec in 1978.
