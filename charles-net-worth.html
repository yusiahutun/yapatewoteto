At the time he became king, Charles was the longest-serving heir apparent in British royal family history and the oldest monarch to assume the British throne at the age of 73 years old. “The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,” Charles said in a statement in September 2022 after the <a href=# rel=noopener>death of his mother</a>. “We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign, and much-loved mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world. During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection on which The Queen was so widely held.”</p><p>In a speech at Buckingham Palace days after he became king, Charles spoke about his “duty to protect the diversity of our country, including by protecting the space for Faith itself and its practice through the religions, cultures, traditions and beliefs to which our hearts and minds direct us.” He continued,&nbsp; “My Christian beliefs have love at their very heart. By my most profound convictions therefore, as well as by my position as sovereign, I hold myself bound to respect those who follow other spiritual paths, as well as those who seek to live their lives according to secular ideals.”</p><p>So what is <a href=# rel=noopener>King Charles’ net worth</a> and how much did he inherit from Queen Elizabeth?

Before he became the King of the United Kingdom, Charles and his wife, Camilla Parker Bowles (now Camilla, Queen Consort) received 90 percent of their income from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which was established in 1337 to financially support the heir to the throne, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CNN</a>. The Duchy of Cornwall is funded through the ownership and operation of land in rural and urban areas, as well as islands and rental cottages in Wales, Cornwall and other areas in the United Kingdom. In 2018, the Duchy of Cornwall made Charles and Camilla $28 million.</p><p>Charles and Camilla also received $1.8 million that year from the Sovereign Grant, a taxpayer fund paid each year to the British royal family, as well as another $627,000 from various United Kingdom departments. The Sovereign Grant originated from an agreement made by King George III in 1760, who agreed to surrender his income from Parliament to receive a set annual payment for himself and future generations of the British royal family. The agreement was originally known as the Civil List before it was reworked as the Sovereign Grant in 2012.</p><p>Under the agreement, the British royal family receives a grant in exchange for surrendering their profits from the Crown Estate, the family’s collection of lands and holdings worth £14.1 billion, to the government, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>. Each year, the reigning monarch receives 25 percent of the Crown Estate’s profits. The amount pays for property upkeep and utilities, the British royal family’s travel and the royal employee payroll. The grant doesn’t cover security and royal ceremonies, which are funded by other areas.&nbsp; According to CNN, about 50 percent of Charles and Camilla’s annual income was spent on travel and official royal engagements, while a quarter went to taxes. The remaining $8.9 million went to Charles’ children with his late wife Princess Diana—Prince William and Prince Harry—as well as non-official purchases and a royal savings account.</p><p>Charles and Camilla are also senior members of The Firm, also known as the Monarchy PLC, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Fortune</a>, which is made up of the public faces of the House of Windsor and the royal family members Queen Elizabeth II—now King Charles—was the head of. The firm operates and a multi-million-pound business empire that boosts the United Kingdom economy through televised events and tourism, according to Fortune. Before her death, The Queen was the head of The Firm. The other seven members were: Charles; Camilla; Prince William; his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge; Princess Anne; Prince Edward; and his wife Sophie, Countess of Essex. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, the British royal family holds almost $28 billion in real estate as of 2021 that cannot be sold and The wealth of the royal family is estimated at $28 billion (£21.3 billion).

Charles became the new King of the United Kingdom after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on September 8, 2022. Charles was the eldest child of the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, who died on April 9, 2021. “The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon,” Buckingham Palace announced in a statement at the time of the Queen’s death. “The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, Charles inherited the Queen’s $500 million in personal assets after her death. Those assets include her personal investments, art collection, jewelry, rare stamps and real estate holdings, which include Sandringham House in Norfolk, England, and the Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where the Queen died. Charles also inherited the Queen’s $70 million in assets from the Queen Mother, which included a stamp collection, fine china, jewels, horses, and even a valuable Faberge egg collection and paintings from artists like Monet, Nash and Carl Fabergé. Charles also didn’t have to pay an inheritance tax on his inheritance from the Queen due to a 1993 agreement between the British royal family and former Prime Minister John Major. Under the agreement, inheritances from sovereign to sovereign are exempt from the United Kingdom’s 40-percent inheritance tax. The agreement was created to avoid the erosion of the British royal family’s wealth.</p><h2>What is King Charles’ net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/King-Charles-2.jpg><p>What is King Charles III’s net worth?

She was the only one so I think she carved her own role,” Camilla said. Camilla also remembered how the Queen taught her to balance work and “enjoyment.”</p><p>“Although she was probably working, you know with her red boxes throughout, she could have her family to stay, she could do the things she loved,” she said. She also recalled the Queen’s “good sense of humor” when Camilla had a mishap with her shoes on her wedding day to Charles. “I probably wasn’t firing on all cylinders, quite nervous and, for some unknown reason, I put on a pair of shoes and one had an inch heel and one had a two-inch heel,” Camilla said. “I was halfway down in the car before I realized… she could see and laughed about it and said, ‘Look, I’m terribly sorry.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/king-charles-book.jpeg><p>With exclusive interviews and extensive research,&nbsp;<a data-pmc-sp-product=78c34dbf83de0cd2a4b1f1f379828455 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"King Charles","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"King Charles: The Man, the Monarch, and the Future of Britain","price":"11.41","id":"1635767997","category":"Political"},"id":1329281,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>King Charles</a> delivers definitive insight into the extraordinary life of His Royal Highness, former Prince of Wales, as he takes the throne, a watershed moment in modern history and in the British monarchy.
