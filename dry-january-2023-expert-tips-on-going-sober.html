Don’t beat yourself up</strong></h3><p id=eptkdP6-Omdv data-wc=58>"If you’re a regular drinker, it’s natural that some parts of the month will be tough," reassures Dr. Tony Rao. "Cravings are normal, and if you have a slip up don’t think of it as failure – it's not, it’s a learning experience. Reflect on what happened – who were you with, what happened, how did you feel?</p><p id=ejY6Ggcd-r2U data-wc=57>"Dry January is about resetting your relationship with alcohol and finding out what leads to having a drink is an important part of learning how not to have a drink. Give yourself some grace and don't let one drink ruin your achievement; celebrate every drink you don’t have.
