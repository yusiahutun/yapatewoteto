The site allows you to watch videos online for free and it features a wide variety of content including anime and documentaries. All films and television shows on the platform are in HD. You can watch lots of them, although you will have to deal with lots of ads. One of the best things about FMovies is that they update their list almost every hour. But is FMovies safe and legal to watch or download movies?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1926cb4cc9d06470.png><p class=align-left>The legality of FMovies has been the most important issue since the site first launched in 2016. Its safety has always been debatable too. Since most streaming sites have their registrations in countries that do not have strict copyright laws, a streaming service may be breaking US copyright laws but continue to operate online legally because it is not registered in the US. For a party to declare it illegal, the copyright holder must file a complaint in the country where the service is registered.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5147ed81492ddc1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to watch movies in Spanish online for free: Best sites in 2021</span></p></a><h2>Is FMovies legal?</h2><p class=align-left>One thing to understand about the site is that it hosts links and embedded videos. Embedding a video is whereby FMovies takes a video from producers and posts it on its webpage outside of the producers’ context. That means users will watch the movie or television show from the site without having to visit the producers’ websites or purchasing it from them.</p><p class=align-left>Technically, it is not illegal to embed a video or host links to any website. The legality aspect of it comes down to how FMovies sources the videos. Did the site acquire it legally from the producers, or did they pirate the movie? At this point, one cannot be 100% certain that it is illegal to watch or download videos from FMovies. It only becomes illegal to watch television shows from the site when the site has no consent from movie producers.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>15 best sites to download movies legally</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb3e7b7cbfa85dd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 best KissAsian alternatives for watching Asian movies in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If FMovies embeds videos on its site, it needs to have permission from producers or distributors. That has not been the case with the streaming website since inception. In June 2017, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US Court ordered</a> FMovies to pay ABS-CBN to pay $210,000 as damages for copyright infringement. The site was found guilty on several counts, including:</p><ul><li>Federal trademark infringement</li><li>False designation of origin</li><li>Direct copyright infringement</li><li>Contributory copyright infringement</li><li>Unfair competition</li><li>False advertising</li></ul><p class=align-left>So, is FMovies illegal based on the six counts against it? The site engages in unlawful activities when conducting its business. Thus, all videos from ABS-CBN and those associated with the Motion Picture Association of America are illegal to watch on its site.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, it is illegal to watch or download movies from FMovies depending on a user’s jurisdiction. Here is an overview of the jurisdictions that consider the site illegal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d8b1d45e49cf623c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 best 5movies alternatives for free movies and TV shows 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In general, FMovies.to may not be a legal site to watch movies.</p><h2>Is FMovies safe</h2><p class=align-left>FMovies is a website that hosts many links. By hosting links, it means FMovies displays an image or a video on its website by linking it to the original site hosting the video. Each time a user clicks on the link, the source or the original site gets the data.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5147ed81492ddc1b.jpg><p class=align-left>In any FMovies review, it would be agreed that hosting links is not illegal. Also, it is safe to do it. But safety reasons arise because of the quality of the links and their original sources. Links on the site may not be safe because of the following reasons.</p><h3>1. The links mask the actual web addresses</h3><p class=align-left>When a user hovers over any link, it does not show the actual address of the website that you are being redirected to. That becomes impossible to determine the authenticity of the destination website.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs4v55mf81h4j.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>YesMovies alternatives to watch movies and TV shows online 2020</span></p></a><h3>2. The site has lots of shortened links</h3><p class=align-left>While there is nothing wrong with shortened links, most of them are from third-party websites that may not have the best intentions for visitors.</p><p class=align-left>So, does FMovies have viruses? The site itself does not have viruses. However, some of the links it hosts on its webpages are questionable.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 50 sites to watch movies online</p><h2>Why FMovies continues to exist</h2><p class=align-left>Despite many countries declaring it illegal, FMovies continues to operate online. Users can also use FMovies APK for android. After filing a copyright complaint and lawsuit, copyright holders only managed to take down the domain name that existed at that time, which was FMovies.to. But since the site embeds videos and hosts links, it is not easy to take down its servers.</p><p class=align-left>That makes it easy for them to change to a different domain name. It is the reason why its domain names have been changing from to time. Some domain names associated with the site include:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/062c816b0ff4b711.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best extratorrent2 alternatives to download movies, music, games, software</span></p></a><ul><li>fmovies.se</li><li>fmovies.is</li><li>bmovies.to</li><li>bmovies.is</li><li>bmovies.pro</li><li>bmovies.ru</li><li>fmovies.taxi</li><li>fmovies.world</li><li>bmovies.online</li></ul><p class=align-left>Its current domain name is fmovies.wtf. Although some of its previous domain names like fmovies.to are functional, they cannot work in jurisdictions where the site is illegal or banned. Most ISPs around the globe have orders to block them. One can only access the sites using proxies or VPNs.</p><h2>Safe and legal alternatives to FMovies</h2><p class=align-left>Because of the legal and safety issues surrounding FMovies, it is best to look for a different site to watch and download movies.
