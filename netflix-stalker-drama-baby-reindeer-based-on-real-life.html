The female stalker regularly pursued him for several years, leaving him living in fear and frustration as he was unable to ascertain a restraining order while she technically kept within the confines of the law, while sending him countless messages and voicemails - over 41,000 in three years. &nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The stalking drama stars the comedian embroiled in the terrifying encounter</figure><p id=eYyF7XkXvNq data-wc=37>The synopsis for the show reads: “Baby Reindeer follows struggling comedian Donny Dunn’s warped relationship with his female stalker and the impact it has on him as he is ultimately forced to face a deeply buried trauma.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35e1a7e16fdf-babyreindeeruniversal-basena02zxx.jpg><p id=eeCffGf15gE data-wc=52>Richard has penned an essay for Netflix, detailing his personal experience with the stalker, explaining: “Sometimes in the pit of despair, inspiration emerges. I was now in the fourth year of being stalked, by a woman, whose only skill greater than her ability to harass was her ability to evade the law.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d697f7ab67a0-br101unit00014rt.jpg><p id=eYNBVZ8FWyK data-wc=77>“She had somehow just obtained my mobile number and I was at the peak of my career at that point, having just returned from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where I had won the Edinburgh Comedy Award for Monkey See Monkey Do.

The show debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2019, and won the Scotsman Fringe First Award and a Stage Award for Acting Excellence.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_eYiKmEOXpj data-wc=68>Speaking about bringing the story to a Netflix season, Richard concluded: “I would be lying if I said I was not back exactly where I was all those years ago in 2019 at the Edinburgh Fringe. Fearing the worst. Praying for the best. Hoping that in amongst all the messy, complicated, [expletive] up, themes Baby Reindeer throws at you that people might take notice of its beating heart.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c714288525bc-br101unit00889rt.jpg><p id=e2oSTtfBoqsQ data-wc=39>The show will also highlight Richard’s complicated relationship with his stalker, with him telling the Guardian back in 2019: “It would be unfair to say she was an awful person and I was a victim. That didn’t feel true.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eaFW8TW43hz9 data-wc=51>He continued: “I did loads of things wrong and made the situation worse. I wasn’t a perfect person [back then], so there’s no point saying I was. And I know as I’m doing those sections that people are thinking I’m not a nice person – which makes them difficult to perform.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/13a4d49aa0a8-baby-reindeer-netflix-drama-everything-we-know-so-far-row.jpg><p id=erCau5YTi87a data-wc=49>So where is Martha now? As of 2019, she was restrained from contacting the artist himself but had found ways to harass his friends and family. “She needs help,” Richard explained. “But she’s not getting any.
