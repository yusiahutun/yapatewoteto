One common issue is when Windows stays stuck in the “Getting Windows Ready” loop. In this article, we look at some surefire ways to get rid of this debilitating error. But before that, let’s cover the possible immediate causes of this error.</p><h2 id=the-possible-causes-of-the-ldquo-getting-windows-ready-rdquo-error>The Possible Causes of the “Getting Windows Ready” Error</h2><p>Remember, like with all things Windows, many factors may be tinkering with the smooth working of your PC. With that said, some factors are more likely than others to lead you to the “getting Windows ready” loop. These are as follows:</p><li>A slow internet speed or an interruption in your network.</li><li>A slow PC that can't quickly boot up.</li><li>An operating system that hasn't been updated in a long time and needs to download and install a lot of data.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-actionable-ways-to-solve-ldquo-getting-windows-ready-rdquo-error>5 Actionable Ways to Solve “Getting Windows Ready” Error</h2><p>Whatever may be causing the "Getting Windows Ready" glitch on your Windows 10, we’ve rounded up the best methods that you take to get back into your workflow. Let’s start with the first and most basic one.</p><h3 id=give-windows-a-little-more-time>1. Give Windows a Little More Time</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/coffee-cup-in-front-of-have-a-break-sign.jpg><p>Seriously. Leave it be. Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing. If you aren’t hard-pressed for time, consider leaving your PC as it is, for as long as it takes. It’s normal for the update process to take some time, especially if you haven’t updated your PC for a while or your internet connection is slow.</p><p>Try leaving it to update for the whole day. If there's still no progress, then the issue probably lies in something else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=check-your-internet-connection>2. Check Your Internet Connection</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lan-router.jpg><p>As we've said above, if something has gone iffy with your internet connection itself, then you’d obviously face trouble in updating your PC. Double-check to make sure that that’s not the case, and try to resolve it if it is.</p><p>If you’re using a wired connection, take a look at your router. Unplug and plug the cable into your router to see if it’s working. If you're on Wi-Fi, double-check to see if your internet connection is working properly. If you think something's not right, try some <a href=#>fixes to get your Wi-Fi back in action</a>, or plug in an Ethernet cable.</p><h3 id=perform-a-hard-shutdown>3. Perform a Hard Shutdown</h3><p>If you’ve tried the two methods from above and are still stuck with the "getting Windows ready" screen, then we’d recommend you try shutting the computer down. We’ll repeat: Only try this method after you’ve given the above methods a shot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When your Windows is getting updated, an abrupt shutdown might lead to the corruption of critical system files. You may even end up with the dreaded <a href=#>blue screen of death error</a> on your computer.</p><p>Some people might say you won't lose your files after a forced shutdown, especially after the new componentization architecture that came with Windows Vista, known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Component-Based Servicing</a>. Despite this, we'd advise you to act with caution and never take unnecessary chances with your system.</p><p>But if you’ve made up your mind that you want to take a chance, here’s how you can do a force shutdown: If you’re on a laptop, press and hold the power button until your system shuts down. Then, restart your system, and you’ll either see the updates download again, or the system will boot up normally. If you’re on a PC, simply turn it off from your power source.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If everything goes right, your computer will be back without any issues.</p><h3 id=use-the-startup-repair-tool>4. Use the Startup Repair Tool</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Startup-repair-windows.jpg><p>Startup Repair is a free, handy tool that comes packed in the System Recovery Options menu on your Windows operating system. It helps you automatically resolve many complex problems pertaining to accidental data loss, startup problems, and more. Also helpful in fixing your Windows booting problems, it can be used to fix the "Getting Windows Ready" error without any difficulties. To get started, follow the steps below:</p><li>Create a Windows installation media on a USB drive. If you need advice on how to do this, follow our guide on <a href=#>how to create Windows 10 installation media</a> for a USB stick.</li><li>Boot your computer with the USB drive and choose the <strong>Repair your computer</strong> option from there.</li><li>From there, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Now, on the <strong>Advanced options</strong> screen, click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Startup Repair option will begin looking for errors and problems on your computer and resolve as many of them as possible. When the process is complete, shut down your Windows and boot up it again to see if the problem persists.</p><h3 id=perform-a-factory-reset>5. Perform a Factory Reset</h3><p>Factory Reset, as the name implies, completely erases the copy of Windows on your computer. It then installs a fresh copy of the operating system so that it's just as new as when you first bought it. It’s a handy tool from Microsoft that can rescue you from all kinds of Windows problems. In this case, you can use the Factory reset to fix the "Windows Getting Ready" loop error.</p><p>The Factory reset comes with two different modes of resets: <strong>Keep my files</strong> and <strong>Remove everything</strong>. <strong>Keep my files</strong> deletes Windows and any additional apps and updates you installed on top of it, but it will keep your documents intact. On the other hand, the <strong>Remove everything </strong>option will do the obvious: It will delete everything on your PC and then reinstall the Windows from scratch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/factory-reset-1.jpg><p>To get started, boot your PC with the bootable USB as we did in the above method, and select the option to format your PC. Follow the instructions ahead, and you'll have a fresh Windows 10 with you in no time.</p><h2 id=the-ldquo-getting-windows-ready-rdquo-screen-fixed-for-good>The “Getting Windows Ready” Screen, Fixed for Good</h2><p>Getting stuck in a “getting Windows ready” loop is a debilitating issue for sure. Even more so when you have an important deadline to meet. Hopefully, one of the methods listed above did the trick for you.</p><p>Although Windows has improved a lot over the years, we believe there’s still a huge window for improvement; the "Getting Windows Ready" loop is one of the many errors that make starting up your Windows a pain. So make sure you know the all best practices to get out any boot problems you might encounter on your PC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGienqyknruoedaipZ2np6h6s7HAnbBmnaKnvLN51qKlnaenqHpyfI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./claudia-lovera.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Claudia Lovera dating?
