Along with her brown tulle skirt and matching brown top, she wore a poop emoji hat atop her head.</p><p>So, why this getup in particular? As anyone who's been watching the trial daily can attest to, the issue of defecation has come up numerous times throughout the court proceedings.</p><p>Depp has claimed after their last big fight on April 21, 2016, he was sent photos from his security guards of the ex-couple's bed, which was covered with "human fecal matter." Depp's driver also testified that he heard Amber call the incident "a horrible practical joke gone wrong."</p><p>Heard, however, said Boo, who was Depp's dog, "had eaten Johnny's weed when she was a puppy and had bowel control issues for her entire life." She said she didn't notice anything in the bed that morning, but also left the dogs alone in bed while they packed for the trip. When asked about the "practical joke gone wrong" comment or whether she had committed a prank, Heard said, "Absolutely not." She added, "I don't think that's funny. I don't know what grown woman does. I was not in a pranking mood."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0fb8f40f-bd51-4fe8-bb2c-f754785d6d7e data-container-ref=toofab:article:4d60087a-684f-4d72-a767-42be4a668a00 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8b/5by4/2022/05/16/8bf9af987fc94a59940a95a5516945f4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Amber Heard Says Poop Incident Sparked Last Major Fight with Johnny Depp</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>On Monday, another fan made headlines for interrupting court by announcing that Depp was the father of her newborn baby. The bizarre incident occurred during the morning break, when the cameras were switched off, so it was not broadcast.</p><p>But Law & Crime's Angenette Levy watched it happen first hand, describing it as "crazy".</p><p>"All of a sudden, this woman... she stands up at the back of the courtroom with her baby, and she says 'Johnny I love you, our souls are connected.'"</p><p>Depp turned and waved to the woman, who was removed from the court and had her access wristband clipped off. After later tracking her down, the woman told Law & Crime that she had discussed the plan with her husband, and that "they thought it was a joke, and thought it would be funny."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e103deeb-ed83-46e4-af75-45eb221a7714 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4d60087a-684f-4d72-a767-42be4a668a00 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/73/5by4/2022/05/23/73d9fabd391747e2b878c35d34befcb1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/YouTube/Law&Crime</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Announces in Middle of Courtroom Johnny Depp is Father of Her Baby</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Another fan made headlines earlier in the case after she was spotted outside the courthouse with a pair of alpacas (below). The animals were brought to the court in reference to Depp previously claiming he wouldn't do another "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie for "$300 million and a million alpacas."</p><p>Depp is seeking $50 million in damages after Heard claimed she was a survivor of domestic abuse in an op-ed in the Washington Post in 2018. While she didn't name Depp in the piece, his lawyers argue it was implied to be about him and negatively affected his career. She countersued Depp for $100 million.</p><p>The actor has already lost an earlier lawsuit he took in the UK over the same article that appeared in The Sun.</p><p>The trial is ongoing -- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/johnnydepp/>see all of our coverage here.</a></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b4/4by3/2022/05/24/b4a5d82eabde4da493992d63bb9c5be1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j25ma2xfn7ypus2yZJ2doKV6ornBnqlmoJWWv6V5xZqlZpyimsC0sdJmmKxloKS8sXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lou-reed-performs-new-persol-sunglass-exhibit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lou Reed Performs for New Persol Sunglass Exhibit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./claire-saffitz-on-her-secret-weapon-hostess-gift.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Claire Saffitz's Recipe for Brown Butter and Sage Sabl Cookies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
