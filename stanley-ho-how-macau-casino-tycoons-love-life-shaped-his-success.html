Although he got to know the taste of comfort at an early age, his father eventually went bankrupt and the family fell into poverty while he was a teenager.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Memorable reign of the ‘King of Macau’, Stanley Ho</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His Eurasian looks made him popular with the girls, but at that point in his life he did not even have enough money to invite them over for coffee, he later said in an interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Japanese troops invaded in 1941, Ho was a third-year chemistry student at the University of Hong Kong. His mother’s dream had been to see him graduate with honours. Instead, Ho fled to Macau, with what he later said was just HK$10 in his pocket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/30/3c13005c-a167-11ea-8055-0ae12e466049_1320x770_203312.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was in the then Portuguese enclave, which remained neutral during the second world war, that he met Clementina, who had been born in 1923 to a Portuguese lawyer father and a Macanese mother.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To impress Clementina, who the Hong Kong press had dubbed “the No 1 beauty in Macau”, Ho started attending night school to study Portuguese.

It had been set up by Ho and three other tycoons: Teddy Yip Tak-lei, Henry Fok Ying-tung and Yip Hon. Their monopoly would last until 2002 when, after almost four decades, the government of Macau began issuing more gambling licences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many attributed the trust that local authorities had in Ho’s company to Clementina and her family’s influential connections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The couple had four children together: Jane, Robert, Angela and Deborah.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong class="bolddin11 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>KNACK FOR BUSINESS</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet as important as Clementina was in Ho’s life, he followed a practice then common among tycoons, of having multiple girlfriends and wives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He married Lucina Laam King-ying, daughter of a Chinese soldier who fought in the war against Japan, in 1960s Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Polygamy was not outlawed in the territory until 1971.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She gave birth to five children, most of whom ended up following in their father’s entrepreneurial footsteps and taking an active role in his business empire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/30/9cc1046a-a164-11ea-8055-0ae12e466049_1320x770_203312.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her brother Lawrence runs another gambling operator in Macau, Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/30/82e74a7a-a166-11ea-8055-0ae12e466049_1320x770_203312.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Siblings Daisy and Maisy also hold positions in Ho’s companies.

Some suggested that this was because of a mix of genuine love and superstition, as it is said that an astrologer once told Ho that she was his lucky talisman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clementina used to spend long stints in Portugal, where the couple bought a house and had investments.

One of the stories told among the Macanese community is of how he would pay people to visit Clementina at their home in Penha Hill to play mahjong and lose. Mahjong was a game that Clementina much appreciated, but from which she reportedly derived little joy if she did not get to win.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After their son Robert – presumed successor to Ho’s empire – was killed in a car crash in Portugal with his wife, model Suki Potier, in 1981, Clementina’s health deteriorated further.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/05/26/stanley_ho_thumbnail_no_logo.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:06</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">The life of Macau’s gambling tycoon Stanley Ho</p><p>The life of Macau’s gambling tycoon Stanley Ho</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ina Chan, one of the nurses brought in to look after Clementina, would become Ho’s third wife, although multiple news reports said the two never actually got married.
