By proudly embracing her African features, Beyoncé encourages her listeners to take pride in their unique identities as well.The song takes viewers on a visually stimulating journey, depicting scenes of Black resistance and unity. The imagery of a flooded New Orleans combined with powerful choreography showcases strength in the face of adversity, alluding to the Hurricane Katrina disaster and systemic racism. "Formation" boldly reinforces the importance of Black culture, history, and resilience.2. "Freedom":Collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on her 2016 album "Lemonade," Beyoncé delivers a powerful message about freedom and the fight against oppression. In the song, she sings, "I'ma keep running 'cause a winner don't quit on themselves." These lyrics serve as a rallying cry, emphasizing the unyielding spirit of Black individuals in the pursuit of justice and equality."FREEDOM" is an electric and energetic anthem that highlights the strength and courage within the Black community. The song's lyrics and music video showcase the strength and resilience of Black people throughout history, reminding listeners of their intrinsic power and the need to continue pushing for liberation.3. "Brown Skin Girl":In her 2019 album "The Lion King: The Gift," Beyoncé celebrates the beauty and self-worth of Black women with the song "Brown Skin Girl." Featuring fellow artists WizKid, Saint Jhn, and Blue Ivy Carter, the track promotes self-love and empowerment for individuals with darker skin tones. By singing "Brown skin girl, your skin just like pearls, the best thing in the world," Beyoncé provides affirmation and validation that is often underrepresented in mainstream media.This uplifting anthem highlights Black beauty and serves as an ode to the unique experiences and struggles faced specifically by Black women. With this song, Beyoncé empowers Black girls everywhere to embrace their natural beauty and to be proud of who they are.4. "Black Parade":Released in 2020, "Black Parade" was Beyoncé's response to the racial injustices and protests that arose after the murder of George Floyd. The song celebrates Black culture and excellence, with lyrics like "I'm for my sisters, I'm for my brothers, respect to my people, one love.""Black Parade" encourages economic empowerment within the Black community, as Beyoncé sings, "Need peace and reparation for my people."
