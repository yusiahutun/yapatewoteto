Donovan Mitchell currently plays for the Utah Jazz as their Shooting Guard.</span></h3><h2><span id=NBA_player_Donovan_Mitchell_cleared_of_coronavirus>NBA player, Donovan Mitchell cleared of coronavirus!</span></h2><p>Donovan Mitchell did his first public interview since he tested positive for coronavirus on March 12, speaking to ABC’s Robyn Roberts during the March 16 edition of “Good Morning America.” In that interview, Mitchell repeatedly said he showed no symptoms or signs of the virus and has been in quarantine ever since being diagnosed.</p><p>“The biggest thing for me is just to stay in isolation and just keep to myself,” Mitchell said. “I have no symptoms, which is a unique situation. I keep making the joke to people who ask that if you were to tell me I might play in a seven-game series tomorrow, I’d be ready to lace up. I’m blessed that that’s the case.”</p><p>Mitchell’s case came after his teammate, All-Star center Rudy Gobert, became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the NBA on March 11. Aside from Mitchell, Piston’s big man Christian Wood — who matched up against Gobert in Utah’s March 7 road win — also reportedly has coronavirus as well in the news that broke over the weekend.</p><p>Over the weekend, both Gobert and Mitchell posted videos via the NBA to update fans on their condition. In Mitchell’s video, he said he is feeling “fine” and “taking the proper precautions” in being in isolation. “I’m asymptomatic. I don’t have any symptoms,” Mitchell announced Monday on “Good Morning America.”</p><p>“I could walk down the street. If it wasn’t public knowledge that I was sick, you wouldn’t know it. I think that’s the scariest part of the virus: you may seem fine, be fine, but you never know who you may be talking to and who they’re going home to.”</p><h4><span>Gobert’s post</span></h4><p>It is not recognized if Gobert is responsible for Mitchell contracting the virus, or vice versa. On Friday, Gobert posted on social media to apologize for his actions, writing: “I have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis…mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment. The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.”</p><p>Mitchell told “Good Morning America” he had seen Gobert’s postings and videos online. However, he said he needed some time to get over his anger in the wake of being diagnosed with coronavirus.</p><p>“To be honest with you, it took a while for me to cool off. I read what he said and I heard what he said. I’m glad he’s doing OK, I’m glad I’m doing well,” Mitchell said. “I’m just really happy, to be honest, Robyn, that it’s just — I hate to say this — just two of us and it wasn’t the whole party at the end of the day. Neither he nor I have children at home — I have some teammates that have children, and some staff that has children at home. So, I’m glad we were able to kind of contain it as much as possible.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-30256 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Donovan-Mitchell-corona.jpg alt="Donovan Mitchell" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-30256 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Donovan Mitchell clicking a picture while in Quarantine days. Source: Instagram</p><h4><span>How is Mitchell doing?</span></h4><p>Mitchell says he has spent his time in quarantine playing NBA 2K20, watching movies, and watching some old highlights of himself from his college to his NBA days. However, none of those things replicate the joy of playing the games.</p><p>“I think as of the basketball world saw yesterday, some of the guys are watching their old highlights,” Mitchell said in the interview. “I’ve been doing a lot of that. I’ve watched myself through college, and I’ve watched myself through the NBA … it’s kind of bringing back good memories, but you miss the game. You miss playing in front of some of the best fans in the world in the NBA.”</p><p>Mitchell made it known during the “Good Morning America” interview that he would be helping to pay for lunches in the Granite School District in Salt Lake City. The program, which the team announced Monday, will allow students in the district to obtain a meal at no charge while schools are participating in enclosures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“As we all navigate the challenges that have arisen with COVID-19, there are many people impacted,” Mitchell said in a statement released by the team. “My mom’s career in education made me value children and the importance of academics, and I want to make sure that kids can continue to eat a meal while they can’t go to school.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Donovan Mitchell Jr. was born on <strong>September 7, 1996</strong>, in Elmsford, New York, as Donovan Vernell Mitchell Jr. And is currently, <strong>27 years old</strong>.
