Unsurprisingly, this format lends fertile ground to open interpretation of what really happened between the band members, with the showrunners taking creative liberties and reading between the lines in order to effectively portray the band's demise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We realized that a lot [of the book] is allusions to moments, things that she said or he said, but you might be missing the actual scene of what happened. So we got to invent those scenes from scratch—entire moments that we got to write from from beginning to end, which isn’t always the case with an adaptation," writer Scott Neustadter told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/6259167/daisy-jones-and-the-six-tv-book-differences/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TIME class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">TIME</a>. "It afforded us so much fun and so many kinds of opportunities for drama will hopefully deepen the story."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Time will tell whether or not fans of the book will appreciate the changes they made. In the meantime, read ahead for an episode by episode breakdown of every difference between the book and the show—and make sure to watch this space for updates.</p><img alt="daisy jones" title="Daisy Jones and The Six - First Look" width=3000 height=2001 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/djts-s1-gl-16-220223-litpam-00085r-3000-6401085d529ec.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Episodes 1-3</h2><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong><u>Pete, the sixth band member, isn't in the show.</u></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The most glaringly obvious difference between the show and the book is that the adaptation completely omits Pete Loving, The Six's bassist and the brother of guitarist Eddie Loving (whose last name is changed to Roundtree in the series).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the novel, Pete is a minor character who eventually leaves the band to marry his longtime girlfriend, Jenny. While the band was originally known as the Dunne Brothers—referring to lead singer-songwriter Billy Dunne and lead guitarist Graham Dunne—they eventually changed the name to The Six to represent all six band members.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the show, The Six only ever refers to the five remaining band members sans Pete. As the group brainstorms a new name in Episode 2, keyboardist Karen Sirko suggests "The Six," implying that Camila, Billy's wife, is the band's honorary sixth member.</p><img alt="sebastian chacon warren, sam claflin billy, camila morrone camila, josh whitehouse eddie, will harrison graham" title="Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/djts-s1-ut-101-211103-terlac-00569rc-3000-6401022da98f2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lacey Terrell/Prime Video</span><p>Band members Warren, Billy, Eddie, and Graham, as well as Billy’s wife, Camila.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Showrunner Neustadter explained Pete's absence to TIME. "The Pete character serves a function in the novel, but he doesn’t have much to say, he’s not the most dramatic," he told the outlet. "We knew if we were going to cast Pete, the actor might want more to do. It felt like eliminating Pete enabled us to do more with the characters that we had in the ensemble, which was already a pretty big group of people. And I hope everyone, especially the Pete stans, forgive us after they watch the show."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another former band member whose storyline gets tweaked? Chuck Williams, the band's original rhythm guitarist, gets a more generous ending in the show when he quits the band to become a dentist. But, in the novel, Chuck leaves the band after being drafted to the Vietnam War, and dies shortly after his deployment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong><u>The music documentary begins 20 years after the band's breakup.</u></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The book sets the documentary to take place about 40 years after the band's infamous '70s breakup. But, the show has the former band members sit down to talk about their experience just 20 years later. The change means that, when we see the band presumably in the present-day, they aren't as transformed as they might have been in the book (which also probably saves the cast and crew plenty of time when it comes to old-age makeup effects).</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong><u>Camila moves with the band to Los Angeles.</u></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Originally, Camila remains in Pittsburgh while The Six embarks on a national tour for their first album. However, in the show, Camila moves with the band to Los Angeles before they even secure a recording deal. There, she plays a key role in publicizing The Six to different record labels and producers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show also modified Camila and Billy's meet-cute. While the novel has the to-be-spouses meet at a wedding where The Six was hired to play, Camila and Billy meet at a laundromat in the TV series.</p><img alt="camila morrone camila" title="Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/djts-s1-ut-101-210929-terlac-00054rc-3000-6401053d3b016.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lacey Terrell/Prime Video</span><p>Camila in Episode 1.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong><u>Daisy gets a different start in the music industry.</u></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Daisy's career begins when she gets discovered by Hank Allen, who would go on to briefly become her manager and slimeball boyfriend. Through him, she signs onto a deal with Runner Records, though she refuses to record music when she's told to sing songs that she hasn't written.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show bypasses that storyline altogether. Instead, Daisy's best friend, disco singer Simone Jackson, introduces her to Runner Records producer Teddy Price. It's Teddy who not only convinces Daisy to strengthen her songwriting skills, but to also collaborate with The Six's lead singer, Billy.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong><u>Daisy and Simone are closer in age and become long-term roommates.</u></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After quickly striking up a friendship with Simone, Daisy moves into her Laurel Canyon house. However, when Simone's first album flops, the disco singer is forced to relinquish the property and move in with her cousin—meaning Daisy also has to move back in with her estranged parents. The book also describes Daisy and Simone's large age gap, with the elder Simone encouraging Daisy to finish her high school graduation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show develops their cohabitating relationship more, with Daisy signing onto Simone's apartment lease as a long-term roommate and getting a job as a diner waitress. The show also shrinks the age gap between the two friends, seemingly aging up Daisy so she isn't a high school student when her and Simone first meet.</p><img alt="riley keough daisy" title="Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six" width=1996 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/djts-s1-ut-103-211124-terlac-00051rc-3000-64011a29eeaf2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lacey Terrell/Prime Video</span><p>Daisy practices the guitar at her and Simone's apartment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong><u>Simone gets a new love interest.</u></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Simone is Daisy's best friend, there is little we know of her personal life based on the novel. The miniseries does well to flesh out her character and narrative arc beyond the book's parameters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Episode 3, she strikes up a romance with Bernice, a new character who doesn't exist in the book. Bernice is a DJ who works in the queer underground club scene in New York, a detail that will presumably influence Simone's cross-country move later in the story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We wanted to explore what it meant to be a queer Black woman in the world in that moment in time," Neustadter told TIME. "What would have to be compromised, what would have to be hidden? And especially in the world of disco, which is so much about freedom and expression, that dichotomy was was very interesting to us. We also really wanted to make sure that she was her own character, not someone whose only function was guiding Daisy’s story. That was really important to everybody."</p><img alt="nabiyah be simone right" title="Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/djts-s1-ut-103-211119-terlac-00481rc-3000-64011ad6bc7d4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lacey Terrell/Prime Video</span><p>Simone meets Bernice in Episode 3.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong><u>Rod Reyes's role as the band's manager is reduced.</u></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the book, Rod discovers the band while they're playing a gig at a New York bar. He immediately becomes an integral factor in The Six's come-up, offering suggestions for their appearance and sound, setting up shows and tour dates, encouraging them to move to LA, and personally introducing them to producer Teddy Price. His involvement is described as the band's "watershed moment."</p><img alt="will harrison graham, timothy olyphant rod" title="Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/djts-s1-ut-101-211103-terlac-00423rc-3000-640120327e430.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lacey Terrell/Prime Video</span><p>Rod Reyes in Episode 1.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, Rod is less present in the show than he is in the book. "I'm a tour manager, not a band manager," he tells the group in Episode 2 when they spontaneously appear at his LA apartment complex after a brief meeting in Pittsburgh. The extent of his involvement in the band's rise to fame ends after he arranges their first gig in LA and helps them recruit Karen Sirko as a keyboardist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rod isn't there for the band's fateful first meeting with Teddy. Instead, that introduction occurs when Billy and Graham accidentally stumble upon the producer at a local grocery store.</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong><u>Daisy does, indeed, wear shoes.</u></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Readers of the book may remember that a key characteristic of Daisy's appearance was that she pretty much never wore shoes. Thankfully, the show eschewed that small wardrobe detail, instead dressing the songstress in practical, period-appropriate footwear as she traipses all over the Sunset Strip. (Walking barefoot on those grime-covered sidewalks? Yeah, no thanks.)</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Episodes 4-6</h2><h2 data-node-id=44 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong><u>Daisy doesn't open for The Six on tour.</u></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><u></u>In the book, Daisy joins The Six on their world tour as their opening act. Instead of going on tour, however, The Six just end up playing at a music festival in Hawaii, where Daisy is slated to join them for a performance of "Look At Us Now (Honeycomb)."<u></u></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong><u>Camila pulls some strings to get Daisy to join the band.</u></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In defiance of Billy stubbornly refusing to have Daisy join the band, Camila throws a party at their Laurel Canyon home and invites Daisy in Episode 4. "I wasn't gonna let his ego stop him from becoming great," she explains in the present-day. At the party, Daisy and Billy get into a tiff, and when it seems like all hope is lost, Camila convinces Daisy to stay and give the band another shot, thus playing a crucial role in Daisy's official entrance into The Six.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It doesn't quite happen like that in the book. Originally, a Rolling Stone reporter who joins the band and Daisy on their world tour makes the suggestion that Daisy should become an official member of the band—and the rest is history.</p><img alt="riley keough daisy, sam claflin billy" title="Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/djts-s1-ut-104-211028-terlac-00264rc-3000-640b8048362bd.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lacey Terrell/Prime Video</span></p><h2 data-node-id=50 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><u>Billy and Daisy kiss.</u></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though book-version Billy swears up and down that he remained faithful to Camila ever since he got sober again, the Prime Video adaptation is willing to read in between the lines and portray a particularly steamy scene that doesn't explicitly occur in the novel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Daisy walks out of a heated studio session, in which Billy berates her for not singing passionately enough, he chases after her. "Tell me that there's nothing going on between us," Daisy dares him. "Tell me that this thing, that the way I feel, that this is in my fucking head." His response? He grabs her head and pulls her in for a deep kiss.</p><h2 data-node-id=53 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><u>Camila takes the photo used on the Aurora album cover.</u></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Originally, a professional photographer shoots the infamous cover of the Aurora album, which shows Billy and Daisy's torsos nearly pressed against each other. But, in the miniseries, Camila, an aspiring photographer, secretly captures the two having an argument during a band photoshoot session in the desert. When Billy later complains to her that he dislikes all of the pictures shot from that day, Camila presents him with her photograph, showing Daisy raising her arms in the wind as Billy intensely stares down at her. "We used to fight like that," Camila tells him, prompting a moment where the two can finally talk openly about Billy's complicated feelings for Daisy. "If you love her ... if you ever do, that is when this ends," she warns Billy.</p><img alt="aurora album cover" title="Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six - Album Cover" width=1425 height=1425 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/aurora-digital-cover-final2-640b9e4f25c92.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span></p><h2 data-node-id=56 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><u>Camila has a fling with Eddie.</u></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The novel hints that there may have been an instance in which Camila was unfaithful to Billy during an hourslong lunch she had with a former high school sweetheart.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the miniseries, this plays out as Camila spontaneously leaving Billy at home for a night out, when she goes to a rooftop bar and bumps into Eddie. There, she gets emotional upon receiving Eddie's earnest attention and care. Though we don't see the specifics of what happens next, it's implied that she ends up cheating on Billy. "There were just so many secrets," present-day Camila explains.
