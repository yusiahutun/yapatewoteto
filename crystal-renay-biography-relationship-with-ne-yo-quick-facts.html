The couple met when Renay was cast as a model for Ne-Yo’s album in 2015. In the romantic relationship that grew out of a business meeting, the two got along so well that within a few weeks of their relationship they became lovers and got tattoos.</p><p>When they talked about how the marriage proposal came about, Renay said that they were in a hotel room and cuddled up together when Neyo first asked the question without the ring. On her birthday, the 30-year-old received a renewed proposal with a fancy diamond ring. While her love life seems to be so perfect, the fact that there is an ex-fiancée Monyetta Shaw, Neyo’s baby mama, made it a bit awkward and controversial.</p><p>However, Crystal Renay said that she and Ne-Yo Shaw talked about their engagement before they published it on social media. According to her, “He told her at my request… …at my request, he told her her way before that. I like her as a person. I would never allow anything in the media to take her by surprise instead of hearing it from us first. NEVER”. It was claimed that the two women had had a controversial feud and she received a warning from Neyo’s ex.
