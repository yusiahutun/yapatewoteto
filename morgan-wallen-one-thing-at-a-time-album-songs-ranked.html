God and the Bible, traditional country music and heartbreak are three big themes across an album that's far more dynamic than either of his previous releases.</p><p>One Thing&nbsp;at a Time is a monster of&nbsp;a&nbsp;project that's reveals quite a bit about who Wallen is. Certain songs explore how he grew up, while others are set in his hometown. He's reflective, but not apologetic. As per usual, he's regretting a love lost far more than he's celebrating a new romance, but there is at least one great love song on the project (see song No. 22).</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>36 Facts About 36 Songs&nbsp;on Morgan Wallen's One Thing&nbsp;at a Time Album</a></p><p>Scroll down to see all 36 songs and then free to drop us a <a href=#>note on Twitter</a> if you think we nailed it or (more likely), you think we're way off.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p>attachment-attachment-One-Thing-at-a-time1</p><p>loading...</p></figure><h3>Morgan Wallen's One Thing&nbsp;at a Time Album, Songs Ranked:</h3><p><strong>1. <a href=#>"Everything I Love"</a></strong>&nbsp; — Wallen borrows a sample from&nbsp;the <a href=#>Allman Brothers Band</a> ("Midnight Rider")&nbsp;to make this traveling song work. It's an ear worm unlike any he's ever released, but lyrically his&nbsp;story of forgotten love sticks to the soul. Hopefully Big Loud releases this song to radio next.</p><p><strong>2. "Ain't That Some"</strong> — As promised, Wallen's hip-hop influences stand out on One Thing at a Time. "Ain't That Some" is the best of them. Expect this song to be huge in clubs in 2023 and beyond.</p><p><strong>3. "Last Night"</strong> — The lyric that bumps "Last Night" up to No. 3 on this list of ranked songs from One Thing&nbsp;at a Time goes like this: "No way it was our last night / I kissed your lips / Made you grip the sheets with your fingertips." We're blushing, Morgan!</p><p><strong>4. "Keith Whitley"</strong> — Credit Wallen for pushing himself vocally on "Keith Whitley," a tribute song that calls out some of the legend's best titles.</p><p><strong>5. "One Thing&nbsp;at a Time"</strong> — At its best, One Thing&nbsp;at a Time delivers funky guitar lines over Wallen's heartbreak. This throwback stands out among the many creative guitar choices.</p><p><strong>6. <a href=#>"You Proof"</a></strong>&nbsp;— It's likely you've heard this song once or twice on the radio.</p><p><strong>7. "'98 Braves"</strong> — If you had to cull One Thing&nbsp;at a Time Down to 12 songs, "'98 Braves" would make the cut. The acoustic strummer is a clever — if specific — metaphor for a love gone wrong.</p><p><strong>8. <a href=#>"Thought You Should Know"</a></strong>&nbsp;— Wallen's most recent No. 1 song was co-written by <a href=#>Miranda Lambert</a>.</p><p><strong>9. "Outlook"</strong> — Morgan Wallen's sister joins him across multiple verses&nbsp;of "Outlook." Their blend is compelling.</p><p><strong>10. <a href=#>"Don't Think Jesus"</a>&nbsp;</strong>— It's surprising how much God and religion show up on Wallen's third studio album. This contemplative ballad is the best of songs that explore this part of the singer's raising.</p><p><strong>11. <a href=#>"Tennessee Fan"</a></strong>&nbsp;— Songs that use University of Tennessee football as a vehicle for a love story are becoming quite common in country music. This sweet lyric is a genuine sentiment for the writer.</p><p><strong>12. "Thinkin' Bout Me"</strong> —&nbsp;Wallen flexes a bit on this trap song. His cool, confident delivery sells his sexy message.</p><p><strong>13. "I Deserve a Drink"</strong> — "I Deserve a Drink" is a real conundrum that strives to capture the feeling of a man longing for a drink he knows he shouldn't have. Effective steel guitar helps move this song to No. 13 on our list of songs from One Thing&nbsp;at a Time, ranked.</p><p><strong>14. "Sunrise"</strong> — Should Wallen choose to perform large portions of One Thing&nbsp;at a Time live, he'll need to memorize a heck of a lot of lyrics. "Sunrise" is a mouthful that ends with a cool metaphor.</p><p><strong>15. "180 (Lifestyle)"</strong> — If you love "Ain't That Some" you'll love "180 (Lifestyle)," its sibling song.</p><p><strong>16. "Born&nbsp;With a Beer&nbsp;in My Hand"</strong> — The album opener doesn't grab the listener by the collar and demand attention. Instead,&nbsp;"Born With a Beer&nbsp;in My Hand" is an acoustic story about Wallen's battle with his demons. A strong lyric and melody need a better arrangement to rank higher here.</p><p><strong>17. "Hope That's True"</strong> — Sonically, "Hope That's True" stands out as a quasi-beachy heartbreak song on One Thing&nbsp;at a Time. Once again a steel guitar builds a compelling track.</p><p><strong>18. "Cowgirls" (Feat. Ernest) —</strong> The collaborations on One Thing&nbsp;at a Time aren't among our favorite songs on Wallen's new album. This hip-hop inspired duet with Ernest is the best of the three.</p><p><strong>19. "I Wrote the Book"</strong> — The '80s style guitar Wallen relies on during "Everything I Love" returns here, paired with a drum track and power melody.</p><p><strong>20. "Neon Star (Country Boy Lullaby)"</strong> — You're not likely to put your baby down to sleep with "Neon Star." It's a barroom lullaby that clips along quickly.</p><p><strong>21. "Man Made a Bar (Feat. Eric Church)"</strong> — Wallen and his hero Eric Church team up for "Man Made a Bar," a song that takes the story of God's creation one day further.</p><p><strong>22. "Dying Man"</strong> — This closing song wraps&nbsp;the album with a story of redemption in the arms of a good woman. Even though&nbsp;Wallen has released nearly 100 songs,&nbsp;he's yet to release a true love song to radio.&nbsp;"Dying Man" may be his finest example of his beating heart to date.</p><p><strong>23. "Whiskey Friends"</strong> — You can actively hear Wallen and his team trying to stretch their sound across One Thing&nbsp;at a Time, an album that's far more dynamic than any he's released to date. "Whiskey Friends" is an example of that&nbsp;flex, but it's a bit buried by others that find a winning formula.</p><p><strong>24. "Single Than She Was"</strong> — This is a story song over a pretty creative synth&nbsp;arrangement that feels both modern and traditional. It's a strong song that many will rank higher than we did.</p><p><strong>25. "Tennessee Numbers"</strong> — No one will label Morgan Wallen's One Thing&nbsp;at a Time a traditional album, but he uses traditional elements with frequency. The steel guitar on this song is another example of his team's creative use of organic instruments.</p><p><strong>26. "Me + All Your Reasons"</strong> — If One Thing&nbsp;at a Time&nbsp;was a circle with the edgiest songs on the outer rim, "Me + All Your Reasons" would be in the dead center.</p><p><strong>27. "Devil Don't Know" —</strong> "Devil Don't Know" includes this standout lyric: "Been trying to drown these demons / But damn if they don’t swim." Many Wallen fans will appreciate his Bible references, while others may find it to be too much.</p><p><strong>28. "Days That End&nbsp;in Why"</strong> — At his best, Wallen's most personal songs are introspective. When he doesn't get it quite right, it sounds like he's feeling sorry for himself.</p><p><strong>29. "Money&nbsp;on Me"</strong> — These next two songs are opposites. "Money&nbsp;on Me" finds the singer telling a girl that he's not a safe bet ...</p><p><strong>30. "Me to Me" </strong>— ... while "Me&nbsp;to Me" (five songs later on the album) is an uptempo bop that asks a girl to bet on him. Which song is better will depend on your mood.</p><p><strong>31. "F150-50"</strong> — Many Morgan Wallen fans would include "F150-50" as a Top 10 song on this list, but we found better lyrics and arrangements.</p><p><strong>32. "Last Drive Down Main"</strong> — "Last Drive Down Main" opens with a hook that's among the least memorable on this album. It should be a great singalong should he choose to play it live, however.</p><p><strong>33. "In the Bible" (Feat. Hardy)</strong> — Hardy and Morgan Wallen are too similar vocally, and thus, this acoustic country boy narrative never takes off.</p><p><strong>34. "Had It"</strong> — When One Thing&nbsp;at a Time was announced, we wrote that&nbsp;because Cuban-American rapper Alex Eskeerdo Izquiedo was a co-writer, this song would "lean hard into&nbsp;(Wallen's) hip-hop influences." They must have had a good chuckle over that, because it sure doesn't. Instead, we get Eric Church vibes.</p><p><strong>35. "Good Girl Gone Missin'"</strong> — This is among the more muted vocal performances on the album. A thin, acoustic guitar lick holds the arrangement up.</p><p><strong>36. "Wine Into Water"</strong> — One song had to be last, and "Wine Into Water" is it for us. The&nbsp;arrangement and lyrics are a bit heavy-handed.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>20 Best Morgan Wallen Songs — Hits Every Fan Should Know by Heart</h2>You'll find largely singles in this Top 20 countdown of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Wallen</a>'s best songs and biggest hits.
