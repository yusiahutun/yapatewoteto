No injuries were reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A message circulating afterward on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, nearly identical to one that followed Monday morning’s bombing at the Caritas Medical Centre in Cheung Sha Wan, seemed to claim responsibility for the border incident, saying it was “only a start” and demanding the government “close the border in two days”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At a press briefing on Tuesday, superintendent Alick McWhirter of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit said the device, which included a light bulb, cable wire and a circuit board, was designed to be detonated by mobile phone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The quantity [of explosive material] being such that had this device exploded, it would potentially have caused either death or serious injury,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Monday night’s attack came to light thanks to a cleaner, who called police at 10.50pm after discovering a toilet ablaze in Kowloon’s King George V Memorial Park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/28/a6804270-418a-11ea-9fd9-ecfbb38a9743_1320x770_194429.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Noticing a strange odour, the cleaner had walked towards the public toilet, where she saw two people run out of a stall for the disabled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No one was injured in the fire, but a toilet seat was seriously damaged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Officers from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit arriving at the scene collected two cans and a glass bottle, among other items, as evidence. A police source said the case, which has been classified as arson, was believed to have been the result of an improvised incendiary device.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier on Monday, at 2.30am, a home-made bomb went off in a men’s toilet cubicle at the Caritas Medical Centre in Cheung Sha Wan. While no one was hurt, about 20 patients were evacuated, and service at the hospital was limited until later in the morning.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Police have been investigating whether the hospital explosion was linked to anti-government protest violence, according to sources, suspecting the home-made device may have been detonated to pressure the government into closing the city’s borders with the mainland in response to the coronavirus epidemic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A message on Telegram, an app widely used by protesters, said the Cheung Sha Wan attack was “just a warning” and “there will be more real bombs to come”, as closing Hong Kong’s borders was the only way to prevent the coronavirus outbreak from worsening in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Organised Crime and Triad Bureau senior superintendent Li Kwai-wah told the press on Tuesday that his department will be handling the case, but no suspects had been identified yet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the maximum penalty for people in unlawful possession of these devices was 14 years behind bars. That would increase to 20 years if they put the explosives into use, and a life sentence if injuries were caused.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When the whole city is fighting an epidemic, why are these people still committing such acts? It’s very infuriating really,” Li said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu warned two weeks ago of “high risks of home-made bombs” after police uncovered similar cases.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Bomb found in rubbish bin at Shenzhen border control point</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZa7pXnCq6CmnV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtgaYR5hZdorKedqKW5sLDEnWSinZRis7DBzZ1krKCVo8epsc1mmaiqlJq%2Fbq%2FOp6urp5xivbC1za0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./american-vandal-season-two-review-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>American Vandal Season Two Is Full of It</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tara-reid-claps-back-body-shamers-too-skinny-bikini-pic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tara Reid Claps Back at Body-Shamers Saying She's Too Skinny in Bikini Pic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
