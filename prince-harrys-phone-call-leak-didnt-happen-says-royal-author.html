The author, who wrote Harry: Conversations With A Prince, believes information about the call that was ‘leaked’ is untrue – based on her experience. The call had sparked hopes <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> was mending the relationship with his dad. It also apparently featured <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> taking time to speak to her father-in-law as well.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-don-t-actually-believe-prince-harry-made-a-call-to-charles>‘I don’t actually believe Prince Harry made a call to Charles’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1129888236-1024x756.jpg><p>Angela appeared on GB News to talk about a phone call from Prince Harry, his wife Meghan, and their two young children, Archie and Lilibet, in celebration of his milestone birthday, as reported by The Telegraph.</p><p>The report said the Sussexes FaceTimed the monarch to wish him a happy birthday. The outlet also claims this was a turning point amid the <a href=#>royal</a> feud, with the son and father planning to ‘speak again soon’.</p><p>“I don’t actually believe that he rang,” Angela began. “One reason is that King Charles has his day very carefully worked out, and he doesn’t just take phone calls that happen by chance. You can’t ring him directly because he doesn’t have a mobile, and it would have gone through various aides.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry’s ‘sad’ reality after William and Charles took center stage</a></p><p>She continued: “I don’t believe it as well because he would have protected himself. If you’re going to have a birthday and a lovely time, you don’t want Harry ringing you and start moaning and groaning and attacking you, saying ‘You’ve got to Meghan’.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-memoir-creeps-up-again>Prince Harry’s memoir creeps up again</h2><p>She then said that she didn’t think that the king’s relationship with his son and daughter-in-law could come back from all the “nasty, hateful things that he said in his book.”</p><p>The Sussexes have been criticized by experts over alleged attacks against The Firm. A PR expert even said <a href=#>Meghan and Harry ‘airing the Royal Family’s dirty laundry’</a> would come back to bite them.</p><p>Angela suggests that it could <a href=#>be part of a “big plan” as they “want to make money”</a>. She highlights Meghan is alleged to have spoken to the Monarch yet “can’t stand this country”, according to Angela.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-privacy-when-it-suits-them>‘Privacy when it suits them’</h2><p>A Palace insider has also blasted the royal couple as they suggest the phone call, in which their four-year-old son and two-year-old daughter sang Happy Birthday to their grandad, was leaked by former <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress Meghan and Harry themselves.</p><p>A source told Page Six claimed the desire for privacy was in question.</p><p>They said: “Harry and Meghan fight for privacy when it suits them, and yet the minute Harry gets on the phone to the King it’s in a newspaper.”</p><p>It had been reported by The Sunday Times that the pair had been invited to celebrate Charles’ birthday earlier this week on Tuesday, but they had chosen not to come over from America. However, <a href=#>the pair themselves released a statement</a> denying this. Instead, they claimed they hadn’t been invited in the first place.</p><p>A spokesperson for them said: “There has been no contact regarding an invitation to His Majesty’s upcoming birthday. It is disappointing The Sunday Times has misreported this story.”</p><p>A source added that they “had not received any invitation and were unaware of any celebrations until the stories came out.”</p><p>The parents, who moved to their <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> with their children, have not responded to claims they ‘leaked’ the story. Harry in the past has claimed his family and various aides have worked with the British press.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry ‘deeply hurting King Charles has lasting effects’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aEcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2KxkqaCfo7Jur8Clo2aklZa4brDInaWtZZiWvbGxzWaqmrGjYr%2BwxcClZJqtpJ28s3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./qc-eclectic-market-celebrates-1st-anniversary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>QC Eclectic Market celebrates 1st anniversary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./k-drama-queens-who-dont-look-day-over-25-jang-na-ra-jun.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>K-drama queens who dont look a day over 25: Jang Na-ra, Jun Ji-hyun, Ha Ji-won, Go Hyun-jung and</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
