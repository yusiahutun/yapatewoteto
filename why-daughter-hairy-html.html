It may be that you or her father have excessive body hair. Sometimes the condition appears out of the blue and no one else in the family seems to be affected.</p><p>There are two main types of congenital hypertrichosis:</p><p><b>1.</b> Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanugo (CHL) : there is excessive fine un-pigmented or blond hair over some or all of the body, apparent at birth and increasing for the first two years of life.</p><p>After this the hair does not increase in quantity and tends to become less or even disappear during adolescence. The condition is not harmful or dangerous and children are otherwise completely healthy.</p><p><b>2. </b>Ambras syndrome: there is thicker hair typically on the shoulders, face, nose and ears, from birth. The hair tends to be longest over the spine where it grows like a shawl over the shoulders and down the back.</p><p>This syndrome is rare. There may be associated abnormalities of the teeth and gums and abnormal facial features.</p><p>As your daughter's excessive hair is only on her back it sounds as if she has CHL. The good news if this is the case is that it should become less obvious and may even disappear during puberty.</p><p>However, it is important that she sees a dermatologist (skin specialist). Her GP can refer her. She might need a hair biopsy to check which type of congenital hypertrichosis she might have.</p><p>Once her diagnosis is certain she might want genetic counselling as she grows older about the chances of her children having the same condition.</p><p>There are other possible explanations for excessive body hair. These include:</p><li>Foetal alcohol syndrome (i.e. exposure to excessive alcohol in pregnancy)<br></li><li>Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)<br></li><li>Anorexia nervosa<br></li><li>Imbalance of sex hormones or steroid hormones in the body<br></li><li>Metabolic problems (these are very rare)<br></li><li>Drug treatment with, for example, steroids, interferon, streptomycin and some other drugs<p>Most of these problems would have already come to attention because of the medical problems they would cause in addition to excessive hair. However, your GP night do tests to exclude some of them if appropriate.</p><p>Treatment to remove the excess hair should be with tested safe methods such as waxing or shaving. Laser treatment has not been shown to be a reliable way of removing hair but your dermatologist would advise further.</p><p>I would avoid electrolysis in your daughter at present as it is painful, slow and expensive.</p><p>Remember it is possible that your daughter's excessive hair may go on its own during puberty, avoiding the need for any possibly risky treatments.</p><p><b>We recommend readers seek personal medical attention in appropriate circumstances.</b></p></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2XcWtpbF%2BMtbp5w5qsoKCkmr9utMCiqbJmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./445057-100-romantic-good-luck-exam-wishes-a-lover-boyfriend-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>100+ romantic good luck exam wishes for a lover from boyfriend or girlfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./three-racing-inspired-watches-ideal-motorheads-and.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Three racing-inspired watches, ideal for motorheads and those who cant drive alike</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
