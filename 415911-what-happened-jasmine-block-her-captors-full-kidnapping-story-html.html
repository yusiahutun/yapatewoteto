On August 8, 2017, the world awoke to the sad news that Jasmine Block was missing. The 15-year-old left home without her phone, keys, and a backpack she normally carried. Her bike and scooter were also left at home. At that point, her family realized that she had been kidnapped.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb70d55837c39dc2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Physically Challenged Man Given Weeks to Live, Marries Fiancé in Beautiful Beach Wedding: "Love of My Life"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So, how was Jasmine Block kidnapped? On that fateful day, Jasmine was home alone when she encountered Thomas Barker, 32, outside her house. Mr Barker was her best friend's father and a <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/413407-10-signs-family-doesnt-care-do.html href=#>family </a>acquaintance. When he told her that he needed help with a family situation, she agreed to accompany him to his house.</p><p class=align-left>Upon reaching Mr Barker's house, her captors restrained her and <a id=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/us/minnesota-kidnapped-reward.html href=# rel="nofollow noopener">locked her up </a>in a closet in Barker's trailer about 10 miles away in Carlos. For the next 29 days, Mr Barker and two other men, Joshua Holby, and Steven Powers, sexually and physically assaulted her and threatened her with weapons.</p><p class=align-left>At one time, they even tried to drown her in a bathtub. She opted to remain quiet throughout the ordeal because she was afraid that they would hit her or do something awkward. Jasmine remained in the hands of her captors for 29 days. The men later put her in a duffel bag and moved her to a foreclosed home in Grant County near Mr Melchert's property.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6bcaf9b076d25b12.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mum Quits Job to Drive Her 12-Year-Old Autistic Son to School: "It’s Takes Me One Hour"</span></p></a><h3>Where was Jasmine Block found?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb70d55837c39dc2.jpg><p class=align-left>She got the chance to escape when the captors went to the store to get some food and left her alone in one of the suspect's trucks in rural Barrett, Minnesota. Ms Block did not waste any time, and she ran away as fast as she could. After knocking on the doors of several homes and not getting any responses, she swam across the lake near Mr Melchert's property to get to his house.</p><p class=align-left>Melchert looked out his window and saw something moving in his field about a half-mile away and thought it was a deer.
