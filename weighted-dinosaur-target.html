And no, they’re not popping up on Mom TikTok as the ultimate parent hack for soothing toddlers; they’re popular amongst 20-somethings as an effective and comforting way to soothe anxiety. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">dinosaur weighted plush</a> at <a href=# id=auto-tag_target data-tag=target>Target</a>, specifically, is the one that TikTok users can’t get enough of. There are hundreds of videos of adults sharing footage of them cuddling with the dino on the couch, falling asleep with it and even just holding it on their laps as they work from home throughout the day.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>These weighted pillows from <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Pillowfort at Target</a> weigh just a hair under three pounds, and the weight comes from pellets that are in the belly of the animal. The head, limbs and tail are all lightweight and stuffed. Although this is marketed as a kid’s toy on the website, most of the reviews come from adults who swear by the toy to help ease their anxieties and help them relax at bedtime.</p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

These are the best things to ever happen to me.” The same reviewer is a teacher and picked up a few for the classroom.&nbsp;Another shopper said, “I’m 25 years old and I’m in love with it, great for anxiety. The weight is perfect and it’s really soft and cozy. I think the green Dino is much cuter than the pink in person.”</p><p>TikTok users seem to have the same excitement. They love cuddling with it on the couch while they watch their favorite shows. Holding on to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">this toy</a> is a great way to keep you from scrolling as you watch TV, too. Instead of the urge to hold your phone to doom scroll, propping up this weighted dino is a great way to hold on to something that also helps release a bit of stress.</p><p>The weighted toy comes in a few different forms too. There’s the green dino, a pink dino, a cheetah and even a unicorn. Most shoppers in the reviews say they splurged on the whole collection. It does only <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">weigh 3 pounds</a> so it’s perfect for a child’s room or for yourself if you find that weighted blankets feel a bit too heavy. Either way, this toy is constantly selling out in stores and online, so pick one up now before it sells out again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eopJ5nYWiAeYSSbWawnZmctbWxw2aboqafqK62voytmKuflal8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-chambers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Chambers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./male-celebrities-whove-spoken-about-getting-cosmetic-procedures-tom-cruise-remains-enigma-youthful.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Male celebrities whove spoken about getting cosmetic procedures: Tom Cruise remains an enigma at</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
