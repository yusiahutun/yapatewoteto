Mike McManus, president of Marriage Savers counselling group, said: 'The amount seems excessive. But I'm delighted she won this suit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Our culture has seemed to say in the past that there is nothing wrong with breaking up a marriage.' And a clerk in the North Carolina court remarked: 'We see cases like this once every two or three years usually. But I've a feeling we're going to have a run on them now.' An outsider's view of the United States' capital punishment system tends to see it as a thriving industry, exemplified by southern states like Texas and Georgia, where the electric chairs and lethal injection tables are kept busy clearing the backlog of death row inmates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In fact, 12 of the 50 states have no death penalty and of those that do, no less than 10 have not executed a prisoner since the Supreme Court revived capital punishment as being constitutionally valid in 1976.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even in the most populous state, California, where there is no shortage of crimes requiring the death penalty, only four people sentenced to death have met their maker in two decades.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The reason, of course, is the labyrinthine appeals process, designed to protect a prisoner's right to a fair process but which is routinely exploited by lawyers, leaving hundreds of convicted men and women on death row for an average of at least 10 years before all legal avenues are exploited.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">New Jersey is one of the states which, despite severe crime problems, has not been able to execute a single prisoner since it brought back the death penalty 15 years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although 46 were sentenced to death, more than 30 cases were overturned and the state has managed to keep eight of them on track.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This being an election year, New Jersey's governor Christine Todd Whitman has called together a commission to look at ways of speeding up the appeals process. Civil liberties groups are naturally outraged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even the newest convert to capital punishment, New York, is having trouble tying the hangman's noose.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After Governor George Pataki fought to introduce the death penalty two years ago, some district attorneys decided on principle to avoid ever asking for it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And now the very first capital case to come to court has been thrown out by a judge ruling it is unconstitutional.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">New York's mistake, it seems, was to introduce a system in which a defendant can avoid the death penalty if he agrees to enter a guilty plea to murder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The judge ruled that by guaranteeing his right to avoid death by doing a plea bargain, he is effectively being stripped of his right to a jury trial.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What about all the innocent defendants who fear being convicted by a jury (and thus face death) and so plead guilty, the judge asked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dead man walking? Not nearly as often as you thought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdiZYN6hZNooa6qqWLApLvRp6pmp6SdsrN51qikmqY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-done-with-divorce-music.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelsea Ballerini Is Wrapping Up Divorce Chapter of Her Music</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jung-kook-3d-lyrics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jung Kook 3D Lyrics, Whats the BTS Members Song With Jack Harlow About?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
