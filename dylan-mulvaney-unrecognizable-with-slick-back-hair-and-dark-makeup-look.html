Usually known for her bubbly style to match her personality, she went for a dark and brooding look to pick up an award.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> star first climbed to fame by documenting her transition on the popular video app. The influencer would open her clips with the number of days it had been since she started her transition. ‘Hi, it’s day 365 of being a girl’, was a big occasion for the star, when it finally rolled around, as it her following grew wildly in that short space of time. But her latest number oozes high <a href=#>fashion</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dylan-mulvaney-s-dark-makeup-look>Dylan Mulvaney’s dark makeup look</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1719477828-1024x783.jpg><p>Swapping out her bubbly bright and bold colors for a sultry, shadowy makeup style, Dylan Mulvaney stood out on the Red Carpet this week.</p><p>On Wednesday, the star rubbed shoulders with other <a href=#>celebrity</a> guests at the Attitude awards show. It was also her big night, as she was named Woman of the Year by the gay lifestyle magazine.</p><p>The US native accepted the gong at the Virgin Atlantic sponsored <a href=#>awards show</a>.</p><p>During her acceptance speech, she explained how much it meant to her.</p><p>Dylan said: “Some see me as the woman of the year, some see me as the woman of a year and some change as I only publicly came out online 560 days ago – and some people don’t see me as a woman at all.”</p><p>She then had a fashion look change, switching up her tulle extravagant gown for a see-through black number, before she took the big ‘a’ award home.</p><p>Her makeup featured a smokey eye, dark plum lips and her hair blonde locks were slicked back. The chic look completed the gray and black tones of the dress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-m-going-to-be-okay>‘I’m going to be okay’</h2><p>Dylan also appeared to address the controversy she has received as her popularity continues to grow.</p><p>Earlier this year, she partnered with Bud Light for an advert, but it ended up causing upset with some fans. A number of drinkers claimed they were going to boycott the brand, and the beer company lost $400m in sales.</p><p>But she tried to stay strong throughout the ordeal.</p><p>Dylan said: “Here’s what I’ve realized: No matter how hard I try or what I wear or what I say or what surgeries I get, I will never reach an acceptable version of womanhood by those hateful people standards.&nbsp;</p><p>“But as long as I have the queer community that sees me for my truth, I’m going to be OK.&nbsp;</p><p>“And I’m equally grateful that this title is happening in the UK and not just because I am deeply attracted to your accents but I because I came to London on holiday this summer after months of feeling isolated and when I arrived I didn’t feel that baggage that I was carrying in the US and I didn’t feel like the trans beer girl.</p><p>“I didn’t walk into rooms and think does that person hate me. I was just another girl walking around in a&nbsp;Burberry&nbsp;trench on her way to a West End musical.”</p><p>She added: “I romanticized this country as a safe place and as dangerous as it is for trans people right now, maybe it’s less about where we are and more about who we’re with – and if I’m surrounded by people like you, this still can be one of my safe spaces.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aAcLDYpZinZZ2qubetzZ6wZq2ep7Kku8anoLOZkqGybsPIrZ9mq5yesKx5wZqapGWYlrazecCnm2ackae4brnApJyuqF2hvLC3jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./levis-501-original-fit-jeans-review-8628380.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Own 3 Pairs of These Timeless, Effortlessly Cool Levi's 501 Jeans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barefoot-contessa-5-ina-gartens-best-corn-recipes-summer-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 of Ina Garten's Best Corn Recipes for Summer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
