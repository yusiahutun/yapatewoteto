In case the sight of them canoodling at Beyoncé’s latest SoFi stadium show wasn’t enough to convince you, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>astrology of Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner</a> proves these lovebirds aren’t just dating for the sake of publicity. In fact, their connection is extremely magnetic, if not downright spiritual. Let’s dive right in to the celebrity relationship that nobody expected and no one can deny, because their birth chart compatibility is fascinating.</p><p>On a surface level, you might not think Kimothée makes any sense at all, but there’s more than meets the eye. Kylie Jenner was born on August 10, 1997 at 5:25 p.m. in Los Angeles, California, making her big three a deadly trifecta: Leo sun, Scorpio moon, and Capricorn rising. Timothée Chalamet was born on December 27, 1995 at 9:16 p.m. in Manhattan, New York, making him an artistic and ambitious Capricorn sun, Pisces moon, and Virgo rising.</p><p>Ever since rumors started circulating about their courtship <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>around April 2023</a>, their relationship has blossomed gradually and secretively, which absolutely tracks when you consider the astrology behind their connection. By exploring the way <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner’s birth charts</a> impact each other, it’s easy to understand what brought these two together and what has kept them together despite the many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Venus retrograde-related breakups</a> that took place this summer.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.86780104712><h2>They Had an Instant Attraction</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/timothee-chalamet-girlfriend.jpg><p>If you never expected to see Kylie Jenner in the arms of handsome, yet quirky Timothée Chalamet, you simply haven’t <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>looked at their birth charts</a> yet. Although they share superficial differences, Kylie & Timothée are deeply attracted to each other and likely felt a spark from the moment they met. Kylie’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Uranus—planet of sudden changes and epiphanies</a>—forms a near-exact conjunction with Timothée’s Venus—planet of love and romance—which can mean this attraction came unexpectedly and with shocking velocity. It also adds an enticing air of unpredictability. And with both partners’ Mars—planet of primal instincts—forming a trine with both of their Venus signs, it’s easy to understand their sexual hunger for each other.</p><p>They may have felt familiar when they met, as though they already knew each other. Both Timothée and Kylie’s sun signs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>fall into each other’s 12th house</a>, which rules over unseen energies, past lives, and spiritual exchanges. This indicates a deeply personal connection that craves privacy and intuitive understanding. In astrology, the 12th house rules over our blind spots; the parts of ourselves we have yet to understand. There’s something about Kylie that reflects something unseen within Timothée and vice versa. They are showing each other all the ways they can be. Their mutual instinct to sustain privacy and secrecy shows that they may see each other as the missing puzzle piece, making them protective of their connection. After all, neither Kylie nor Timothée have ever publicly commented on their relationship, despite its clear intensity.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>There’s something about Kylie that reflects something unseen within Timothée and vice versa. They are showing each other all the ways they can be.</p></figure><p>Although these two prefer to keep their connection sacred and personal, they thrive together when they’re with their close friends. Kylie’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon in Scorpio</a> and Timothée’s compatible moon in Pisces land in both of each other’s third house of communication and tight-knit social circles. This means they feel cozy when surrounded by their mutual friends, where they can flaunt their affection without worry and be a couple their loved one’s enjoy spending time with.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.3997361477573><h2>They See Themselves in Each Other</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kylie-jenner-timothee-chalamet-kissing.jpg><p>Despite the fact that no one saw Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet coming, their birth charts prove they’re actually surprisingly similar people. Kylie’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Capricorn rising</a> forms a conjunction with Timotheé’s Capricorn sun, which reveals their admiration for each other. Timothée is probably fascinated by Kylie’s work ethic and commitment to achieving greatness, as she captures everything he wants to become with ease. Kylie feels similarly inspired by Timothée’s life goal of becoming the best artist he can possibly be.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2><p>When Kylie & Timotheé are fully immersed in their time together, they probably feel like an even more authentic version of themselves.</p></figure><p>When Kylie & Timothée are fully immersed in their time together, they probably feel like an even more authentic version of themselves. This relationship is marked by synastry located in both partner’s first house of the self (aka the ascendant), which means they just “get” each other. Kylie’s Mercury, Venus, and Black Moon Lilith all fall into Timothée’s first house in Virgo, allowing her to reveal the fullest extent of her personality, especially the sexual side. Being with Timothée may even make her feel like a full blown femme fatale with Lilith present there. Timothée returns this affinity, as his Mercury, Venus, Mars, Uranus, and Neptune all fall into Kylie’s first house in Capricorn, making him feel just as seen and understood by the cosmetics mogul.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15.982978723404><h2>Will Their Relationship Last?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/timothee-kylie.png><p>Although the passion between these two is clear, the strength and support of their relationship may be challenged in the long run. In fact, the intensity of their connection may even be the reason why it’s hard to maintain. Because this relationship is marked by 12th house synastry, being in love with each other may make both parties feel incredibly exposed. That means this relationship may trigger parts of their personalities that they may have spent their whole lives hiding from the public eye, leaving them feeling open to embarrassment. It also signifies that their relationship is incredibly karmic, which means they have unfinished business from their past lives to deal with. Once they tie off those loose ends, they may be compelled to part ways in this current incarnation.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2><p>Their relationship is incredibly karmic, which means they have unfinished business from their past lives to deal with.</p></figure><p>There’s no way you can deny these lovebirds feel some type of way about each other. Kylie’s Venus in Virgo forms a trine <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with Timothée’s Neptune</a>—ruler of dreams, fantasies, and illusions—making their relationship a highly magical and transcendent one. However, Kylie’s Mars in Libra also squares off with both Timothée’s Neptune and Uranus, which can make their dreamworld hard to sustain in the real world. There might be something hard to catch about this relationship, as there may be moments both Kylie and Timothée feel unsure about each other’s true intentions and whether their longterm goals intersect.</p><p>However, with Kylie’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>South Node in Pisces</a> forming a conjunction with Timothée’s Saturn in Pisces, along with Timotheé’s South Node in Aries forming a conjunction with Kylie’s Saturn in Aries, it’s clear this relationship is heavy with karma and designed to instill large amounts of growth within each other. Because the South Node is connected to the past, this relationship may come and go after every lesson has been learned. Many astrologers believe South Node synastry—especially as intense as this relationship’s—is always a sign that a connection is meant to be abandoned eventually.</p><p>All of this doesn’t mean we won’t be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>seeing Kylie and Timothée together</a> for a long time. After all, Kylie’s moon in Scorpio forms a trine with Timothée’s moon-Saturn conjunction in Pisces, making them feel liken nesting in each other’s presence, giving them space to nurture something meaningful together. No matter what, it will ultimately leave them changed forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfqbauu9OhnJ5lk52ura3Mnqtmo6mhtqZ5yZ6lp52iYq60wNGoo6ifqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-media-streaming-tools-linux.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 5 Media Streaming Tools for Linux</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./style-edit-richard-mille-strikes-new-partnership-rising.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>STYLE Edit: Richard Mille strikes new partnership with rising tennis star Sebastian Korda, who joins</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
