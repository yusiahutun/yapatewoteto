It makes me happy. I’m more happy than I can tell you,” said an emotional Danny Shum Chap-shing after Romantic Warrior produced a stirring performance to become the first Hong Kong horse since Cape Of Good Hope in 2005 to win in Australia.</p><p>“I want to thank Peter [Lau Pak-fai], the owner, for giving permission to come here. James McDonald. All the team. All the Hong Kong fans. My wife, Christine. My son, Aaron. I love you. I love you all.”</p><p>The enormity of Romantic Warrior’s performance cannot be underestimated, with the five-year-old brushing aside the myriad of challenges that come with campaigning overseas – including Australia’s stringent veterinary procedures – and a host of other hurdles.</p><p>“He overcame all of the challenges and the difficulties,” Shum said of Romantic Warrior, who missed a September trial in Hong Kong because of a typhoon and experienced issues after having to switch off his usual feed for a time.</p><p>Fourth in the Group One Turnbull Stakes (2,000m) on October 7, Romantic Warrior was – according to his trainer – only 90-95 per cent fit heading into the Cox Plate after Shum and his team had fewer and less comprehensive facilities with which to work in Australia than Hong Kong.</p><p>McDonald stayed positive, however, and was euphoric in the aftermath of his second consecutive Cox Plate victory.</p><p>“I showed belief. This horse is pretty special to me. I mentioned if he came to a Cox Plate, he’d be a suitable horse,” McDonald said.</p><p>“I meant what I said, and credit to Peter and Danny. It takes a hell of a lot of balls to come out of Hong Kong with all the prize money. It is one of the best racing jurisdictions in the world, and they come here and showcase their boy.</p><p>“I reckon he’s got more to come, too. He’s been bubbling. A significant amount of improvement like I thought he did, and he loves the bloody Valley.”</p><p>Romantic Warrior’s Cox Plate victory was his fourth Group One win – three of which have come under McDonald – along with his success in last year’s Hong Kong Derby.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/28/4882f6a4-17fb-494a-af6f-e3b04c75c66e_4c0589f6.jpg data-fid=14225394 data-resolution=2 width=2000 height=1333 title="Trainer Danny Shum and jockey James McDonald." alt="Trainer Danny Shum and jockey James McDonald." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>He became just the second Hong Kong horse to win in Australia and handed Shum his second overseas success after his Royal Ascot victory with Little Bridge in the Group One King’s Stand Stakes (1,000m) in 2012.</p><p>The best Hong Kong horse to travel in years, Romantic Warrior’s performance could pave the way for connections of more of the city’s best gallopers to take on international challenges.</p><p>“I think that we have, due to Covid, not been able to show that Hong Kong horses are not only good in Hong Kong but that they are able to compete on the world stage,” said Jockey Club chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges.</p><p>“What Danny and the team did is an amazing achievement because this race comes very early in the season after a five-month break. It is a tremendous training performance, a wonderful ride, and it shows that Hong Kong racing is really globally recognised as one of the leading racing jurisdictions.”</p><p>Romantic Warrior stopped the clock at 2:03.16 – a touch more than a length outside Winx’s track-record 2:02.94 – with the Ben, Will and JD Hayes-trained Mr Brightside a nose away in second.</p><p>“I’d love a rematch. It was only a bob on the line. But we’ll see how the horse is first. If he pulls up well, we could head there,” Ben Hayes said of a potential trip to December’s Longines Hong Kong International Races.</p><p>Quickly away, Romantic Warrior settled forward of midfield before being asked to go by McDonald entering the home turn, cornering four wide and grabbing Mr Brightside on the line in a finish that left many on course thinking the Hayes horse had saluted.</p><h3><a title href=# data-entity-uuid=e1643795-675f-46bc-a12b-1e70698f88af data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article>Warrior’s owner Lau ‘cannot imagine how great’ Cox Plate victory would be</a></h3><p>“I was comfortable. I knew I was on the right horse. I kept going, ‘he’s the best horse, he’s the best horse,’ so I’d ride him like it,” McDonald said.</p><p>“I took a gamble about the 1,000m or 1,200m. We elected to come back a spot, and right now, I believe that was the winning move. Giving my horse an extra length to come back.”</p><p>Alligator Blood finished third, while Zac Purton’s mount, Fangirl, was seventh.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6ScmxraF%2BnvK6tza2gnGWnlr%2Bztc6rZJyqlZbBpr%2BMoaCsrJ%2Bnxm7Ax6ugpaSZo7Rur86xZKmkkamybsLInKuoqqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./titan-submersible-documentary-to-feature-the-mysterious-knocking-heard-from-underwater-see-here-1282757.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Titan Submersible Documentary To Feature The Mysterious Knocking Heard From Underwater?
