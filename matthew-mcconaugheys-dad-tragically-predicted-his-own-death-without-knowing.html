In October 2020, however, he revealed a bizarre story about Jim’s death to promote his book, Greenlights, and it’s a pretty risque memory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-184499863-719x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matthew-mcconaughey-s-dad-predicted-his-death-with-intimate-details>Matthew McConaughey’s dad predicted his death with intimate details</h2><p>McConaughey, 53, divulged details on his father’s passing in his memoir, claiming that Jim once alleged said that that he would die while having intercourse.</p><p>“I got a call from my mom: ‘Your dad died.’ My knees buckled,” the Dallas Buyers Club actor recalled. “I couldn’t believe it. He was my dad. Nobody or nothing could kill him. Except for mom.”</p><p>Matthew continued: “He’d always told me and my brothers, ‘Boys, when I go, I’m gonna be makin’ love to your mother.’ And that’s what happened. He had a heart attack when he climaxed.”</p><p>During the WTF With Marc Maron podcast, the A-list actor shared more details about how things actually went down.</p><p>According to Matthew, when paramedics arrived at his parents’ home, his mom refused to allow her husband to be covered.</p><p>“She kept ripping the sheet off going: ‘Uh-uh, I want the world to see why his nickname was Big Jim, don’t you cover him,’” he recalled.</p><p>James Donald McConaughey was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">born</a> on November 7, 1929 in Jackson, Hinds County, Mississippi.

Talking to Jimmy Kimmel in 2017, the Hollywood star was in kindergarten when a friend invited him to play on the monkey bars.</p><p>His friend called him Matt, and Kay, who was his kindergarten teacher at the time, allegedly told her son: “What’s your name?”</p><p>“Matthew,” he replied.</p><p>KMac warned: “Don’t you ever answer to Matt again.
