(I’ve persuaded him to stop spraying them all white.) So I thought I’d take the opportunity to show you around mine.</span></p><p><span>It’s funny: the first time I ever appeared in Live was when they came to my house for a food interview and we ended up talking cars instead.</span></p><p><span>Not a single one of the cars I had then is still in my collection. I had a beautiful ’59 Corvette and a blue Maserati Mistral but they cost a bomb to run and didn’t handle well so I sold them.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes you look at it and think, ‘What the hell did I buy that for?’ The good news is, you get your money back when you sell it.&nbsp; And then you get another car.</span></p><p><span>Of this lot, the one I’ve had longest is the Fiat Abarth 595. It’s a Sixties Fiat 500 tuned for track racing – although to be honest, this one’s not really competitive.</span></p><p><span>I put a modern-day stereo in it and use it to potter down to the shops. It puts a smile on people’s faces. It should do 70mph – although I’ve never tried – and it goes round corners like a little go-kart. Since the modern Fiat 500 became so popular, they go for about £20-£30,000 now.</span></p><p><span>I got the Abarth at auction for a quarter of that. The only other cars here that I bought at auction are the Works Mini Coopers. Why have I got two?<br></span></p><p><span>I’d have six if I could. As it is, I’ve got one from the start of Mini’s rallying days and one from the end.</span></p><p><span>The 8 EMO is the one my hero Paddy Hopkirk raced in 1963. I’ve kept it all original inside; it’s got all the map lights, twin tanks and a fire extinguisher. The 48F is from 1967.<br></span></p><p><span>It’s subtly different at the back, with different lights and a thing for refuelling faster, but neither will do much more than 70mph. That’s plenty when you’re on a forest stage, believe me.</span></p><p><span>Generally I get my cars from private sales. The classic car market is quite small and people tend to know who owns what at any given time. If there’s a particular car you like and want, you ask an agent to keep an eye out.</span></p><p><span>I’ve got about three, usually Gregor Fisken, DK Engineering and Paul Osborn. They even look abroad, which is what happened with the Ferrari 275 GTB.</span></p><p><span>I tried to buy this 275 six years ago when it was half the price, before the influx of Chinese money. It got sold to a guy who spent a fortune restoring its engine and gearbox.</span></p><p><span>I was live on Saturday Kitchen one day and got a text message from one of my guys saying, ‘Your car’s come up for sale. In Germany.’</span></p><p><span>I had four hours to get on a plane to Germany and half of that time I was live on TV. I made the decision to buy it without seeing it. I’ve never driven any of my cars until I’ve bought them.</span></p><p><span>To understand why I love cars, all you have to do is stick your head inside the 275 and smell. When you&nbsp; start it up it’s even better. It was built for racing in 1965, so it’s not easy to manoeuvre around the drive.</span></p><p><span>You’ve hardly got any steering lock, you’ve got a racing clutch. You’d never drive it in London. But I’d only sell the 275 for one thing: the 250 Short Wheelbase that I test-drove for Live about five years ago. I’m saving up.</span></p><p><span>Sixties Ferraris are iconic; just ask Chris Evans.&nbsp; I don’t like cars from the Seventies, but the Eighties were my childhood and the 288 GTO was on my bedroom wall. I never dreamed I’d own it. I had the chance when it was half the price – but that was the day I bought the Gullwing Mercedes 300SL, the very first car in my collection (long since sold). Prices for the&nbsp; 288 GTO have overtaken the Gullwing now.</span></p><span class=tl>&nbsp;</span> <span class=tr>&nbsp;</span><h3>More from James Martin for The Mail on Sunday...</h3><ul><li class=cleared><span class=arrow-small-r>&nbsp;</span> <a href=#>JAMES MARTIN: When it comes to car crushes, there's none weirder than a bargain-basement SUV, built in India by Romanians</a> <span class=date>04/04/13</span></li><li class=cleared><span class=arrow-small-r>&nbsp;</span> <a href=#>JAMES MARTIN: The big boys may scoff, but I loved the diminutive yet surprisingly agile Fiat Panda 4x4</a> <span class=date>27/03/13</span></li><li class=cleared><span class=arrow-small-r>&nbsp;</span> <a href=#>JAMES MARTIN: A posh but sporty estate, the Jaguar XF Sportbrake certainly has British pedigree</a> <span class=date>22/03/13</span></li><li class=cleared><span class=arrow-small-r>&nbsp;</span> <a href=#>JAMES MARTIN: It may be more school run than off-roader, but the Vauxhall Mokka is this year's must-have mini-SUV</a> <span class=date>13/03/13</span></li><li class=cleared><span class=arrow-small-r>&nbsp;</span> <a href=#>JAMES MARTIN: Too Essex to be a Range Rover, but the Porsche Cayenne GTS is a strong contender to be the sportiest SUV ever made</a> <span class=date>07/03/13</span></li><li class=cleared><span class=arrow-small-r>&nbsp;</span> <a href=#>JAMES MARTIN: How do you improve on a timeless, cordon bleu hatchback like the VW Golf?

Despite that, it’s quite a friendly car to drive – certainly compared to the famously dangerous F40 that came out after the GTO and had the same engine. That’s why these are twice the price.</span></p><p><span>F1 cars are far more expensive to service and run than to buy – although if you had a car that Michael Schumacher had driven you’d be sitting on a goldmine. Schuey didn’t drive my Jordan 197, his brother Ralf did, with Giancarlo Fisichella in the 1997 season.<br></span></p><p><span>I remember seeing this car come second in Buenos Aires on telly.&nbsp; I’ve got a Benetton one from the same year. I like F1 cars from the Nineties, as that was the last era when someone my size could actually get into the car.</span></p><p><span>But of all these, the one everybody loves when I give them the tour is the 1967 Mustang.<br></span></p><p><span>I bought it as a rust-bucket from America and gave it a new engine, new transmission, new suspension, new interior; the only original part is the roof. Some purists said I’d ruined it.</span></p><p><span>But Ford built thousands of these, quite badly, and the handling was atrocious. So why not make it better? I spent a lot of money turning it into something I loved.</span></p><p><span>My rules for car collecting?<br></span></p><p><span>1) Be careful with eBay: I once bought a £1,500 Fiat at 3am then woke up the next day and realised it would cost me £1,600 to collect.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span>2) Don’t tell Chris Evans: I once told him about a Ferrari 512 TR I was due to view that afternoon; he went out in the morning and bought it.<br></span></p><p><span>3) Buy to enjoy, not to invest. You’ve got to drive these things.</span></p><p><span>That’s the most important thing, really. I can’t understand people spending a million quid on a painting, but I can understand this.<br></span></p><p><span>This is moveable art.
