He moved to Los Angeles when he was 20 years old to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian. He performed stand-up for the first time at an open mic night at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood, California.&nbsp; His breakout role came when he starred as Garfield “Garf” Slade with Zac Efron and Seth Rogen in 2014’s Neighbors. That same year, he released his first stand-up comedy special with HBO, Love at the Store. The success of Love at the Store led to two more stand-up comedy specials with HBO: 2017’s 8 and 2022’s Rothaniel, which won Carmichael his first Emmy that same year. The special also saw Carmichael come out as gay publicly.&nbsp; “I feel pretty sturdy, and I feel very adult. In the special, I am honest about things I thought I’d never say out loud,” Carmichael said about Rothaniel in a 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Time</a>. I’ve started feeling more responsibility, which is not a word I would have ever used to describe any of my work. But I definitely started feeling it after coming out.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg><p>After Rothaniel, Carmichael went on to guest host Saturday Night Live, which earned him his second Emmy nomination, as well as the 2023 Golden Globes.

Carmichael hosted the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards in January 2023. While his exact salary to host the Golden Globes hasn’t been confirmed, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a> reported in 2013 that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were paid $4 million each to host the Golden Globes for a second and third time in 2014 and 2015. The deal came after the success of their time as hosts in 2013, which saw ratings increase for the Golden Globes by 28 percent among the 18 to 49 demographic.</p><p>“Tina and Amy decided to ask for the craziest package ever given to awards hosts,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a> at the time. “Tina and Amy will each make $4 million on the deal but also they are getting a huge perks package that includes use of the NBC/Comcast private planes as they prep for the awards and full freight on their entourages, who will all be backstage to support [them] during the live broadcasts.” The source also claimed that Fey and Poelher were paid more than any Golden Globe or Oscar host in the past aside from Billy Crystal, who made almost $5 million to host the 2012 Oscars. “Standard first timer pay for the likes of Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, and Seth MacFarlane is closer to $2 million,” the insider said.</p><p>Representatives for Fey and Poelher, however, denied the comedians were making $4 million each to host the Golden Globes for two years. “The dollar figure that Radar has printed is grossly exaggerated,” the representative said in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a>.

The show producers’ fee was $100,000 each for producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd; the host’s fee was a $15,000 union minimum for host Jimmy Kimmel; the Oscar statuettes fee was $900 each; the security fee was $250,000; and the red carpet fee was $24,700 for a 500 foot to 33 foot carpet&nbsp; (or $1.50 per square foot). The Guardian didn’t cite a fee for the Dolby Theater, however, it reported that the Academy has a complex, 20-year agreement with the theater.</p><h2>What is Jerrod Carmichael’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jerrod-Carmichael-3.jpg><p>What is Jerrod Carmichael’s net worth?
