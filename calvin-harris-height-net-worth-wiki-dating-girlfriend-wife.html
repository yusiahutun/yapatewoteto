He is known as the highest-ranking DJ in the world. With a track record like this, you would have expected the journey to go smoothly, but it didn’t, because he worked hard to achieve this position. His hard work paid off and made him the 30th richest British millionaire in the world. He teamed up with Rihana, Florence Welch, Ellie Goulding, Pharrell Williams, Frank Ocean, and a list of other artists to record high-profile hits.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Calvin Harris Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>Calvin Harris was born on January 17, 1984, in Dumfries, Scotland, and his sun sign is Capricorn. He was born Adam Richard Wiles as the son of his parents David and Pamela Wiles. While his father David was a biochemist, his mother (formerly Pamela Noon) was a housewife who stayed at home. He is the last of three children with an older sister named Sophie Wiles and an older brother named Edward Wiles. Calvin was born in Scotland, belongs to the white ethnic group, and attended Dumfries High School. As a child, he was interested in football and music. When he couldn’t improve on the former, he decided to study full-time later. And although his parents got along well in society, they supported him and encouraged him to take responsibility for his passion. Calvin worked in a supermarket and a fish processing factory to raise money for his DJ equipment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Even at a young age Calvin always wanted to make the headlines and earn good money. At 18, the spectacular star had already recorded two songs Da Bonga and Brighter Days. He felt that the only way to succeed was to move to London, so he worked hard and raised enough money to get there. His expectations did not come true as planned because he could not find work. Soon he ran out of money and he could only publish one of his songs: Let Me Know. He returned home to Dumfries, and while he was there, Calvin began posting his recording on his MySpace page and increasing his popularity there. Tommy Sunshine found his records on the social media platform and Calvin was signed to Sunshine “Xylophone Jones Recordings”. He signed three more contracts with ‘Three Six Zero Group’, ‘EMI’ and ‘Sony BMG’. Calvin Harris released his first album “I Created Disco” in 2007 and sold up to one million copies in the UK.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Where Is Axl Rose Now And How Much Is He Worth?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Is His Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>He has had great success in the music industry, ignoring other DJs before him. He has been ranked as the 30th richest British music millionaire, Forbes as the 21st highest-paid celebrity, received ten Brit Award nominations and won a Grammy for the best music video in 2013. His first album “I Created Disco” earned him millions of dollars and ranked 8th in the UK and 9th in the US. In 2009, Calvin released his second album, Ready For The Weekend, which became a hit and climbed to #9 on the UK album charts, instantly making him an international figure in the music industry. He was immediately discovered by Rihana, and together they recorded We Found Love, Where Have You Been, and This Is What We Came For. The three songs immediately became hits and made him the first to release three songs that suddenly entered the top 10 dance and electronic song charts.</p><p>Calvin has released four albums with 22 top 10 singles and is currently the highest-paid DJ in the world. He was the highest-paid DJ of the year for 2013, 2014 and 2015, when he recorded $46 million, $66 million, and $66 million respectively. In 2015 he was worth $105 million, but his current net worth is estimated at around $48.5 million according to Forbes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Calvin Harris Dating? – Girlfriend, Wife</strong></h2><p>The sensational DJ was never married but was very active in the dating scene. His most popular relationship was with Taylor Swift, and although her flame attracted media attention, it ended with a very sad note. Before Taylor, Calvin in 2013 met Ellie Goulding and dated her, but their relationship lasted only a month and ended before he started dating Rita Ora that same year. This lasted about a year, and Calvin continued with Aarika Wolf in 2014 and broke up again in February 2015.</p><p>Calvin first met Taylor Swift at the Elle Style Awards in February 2015, but they met again the next day at the Brit Awards and clicked on each other. As a result, the two were seen together in shows, supermarkets, and restaurants. Soon after, they made their relationship public by posting a photo of the two of them on Instagram. They caused quite a stir with their PDAs and sent many of their fans into a rage because they were such a lovely couple.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Does Emilia Clarke Have A Boyfriend or Husband?</a></strong></p><p>Calvin Harris and Taylor Swift also overtook Beyonce and Jay-Z to become the richest couple in Hollywood. To celebrate their one year together, Calvin gave Taylor a gold medallion engraved with the anniversary date. Three months later, however, rumors of their separation began to spread, and Calvin confirmed this by posting on his Twitter account in June 2016, which he finally deleted after Taylor weeded him again. Taylor was the first to continue when she started dating Tom Hiddleston just a few weeks later, which caused Calvin to stop following her in the social media. In the weeks that followed, they erased any shared memory of her in social media, including pictures, posts, and videos.</p><p>Rumors spread again about Taylor swift, who claimed to have written Calvin’s and Rihana’s hit “This Is What We Came For,” and as expected, Calvin was inconsolable. He said Taylor and her team had insulted the one thing he was good at, and he felt betrayed and belittled. In 2016, he got back together with Aarika Wolf, and they have been together until today. The couple has yet to tie the knots, and as such Calvin is still a very independent man.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Calvin Harris Height</strong></h2><p>Calvin Harris has a healthy-looking, muscular body, which is solely due to his regular training habits, coupled with his athletic build. The exact measurements of his chest, biceps, and waist are 43-16-32 inches. For his height, Calvin Harris is 6 feet 5 inches tall. He has blond hair and blue eyes. His shoe size is 13 (US size) and he weighs 201 lbs or 91 kg.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKK41aKlZqCRp7%2Bqv4yhnKKfmKl6r7HTZq6oqqSderi1yqJknZmknruoecaiqaWeop6yr7CMsKCfnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pollyanna-mcintosh-age-height-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Facts About Pollyanna McIntoshs Age, Height, And Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./424218-10-hollywood-actors-crazy-real-life-whereabouts-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 former Hollywood actors and actresses who went crazy in real life (and their whereabouts)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
