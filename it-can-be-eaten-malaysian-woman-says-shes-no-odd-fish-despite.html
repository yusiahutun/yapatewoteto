The 26-year-old’s recipe for turning her dead pet koi into soup has rocked social media, amassing thousands of views and comments expressing varying degrees of incredulity.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Omeychua said she had taken the reactions, even those criticising her, in stride.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am feeling OK, I can accept what people are saying. Not all types of food can be in people’s mouths, so that’s why many people are shocked. But it is still fish and it can be eaten,” Omeychua, who is from the Rungus ethnic group in the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah, said in an interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Omeychua, who now lives in the country’s administrative capital of Putrajaya, said she had around 40 Japanese koi in her pond, half of which died when her domestic helper left the tap water on while filling up the pond. Omeychua believes the concentrated levels of chlorine and shortage of oxygen killed the fish, which are “very sensitive”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Pet food: Malaysian woman’s koi soup raises eyebrows after she makes meal out of dead fish</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smaller koi cost between 300 ringgit and 500 ringgit (US$74-US$124), while a larger one can go for up to 1,000 ringgit, she said, and she did not want her precious fish to go to waste.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On a Facebook group called “Masak Apa Tak Jadi Hari Ni”, which roughly translates to “Cooking Fails Of The Day”, Omeychua shared a montage of six pictures, describing her soup dish as a “recipe fit for royalty”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her post went viral, with more than 10,000 reactions and 4,500 comments so far. Some users were aghast at how someone could eat their pets, while others questioned if it was normal for people to eat dead ornamental fish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Facebook, a user said she had once lost 24 big koi fish. “The pool man accidentally drained my fish pond and in an hour or two, the dead koi started smelling so bad,” she wrote. “How can she cook it? You also do not know what koi eat. Most of all, how can you eat your pet?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With their colourful hues and patterns, koi are often seen just as ornamental pets, but they are a variety of carp and are therefore edible. This was why, Omeychua said, they tasted delicious – similar to catfish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I cook and eat all fish that died in a good way. In my hometown, we eat pufferfish too. Sometimes my family and neighbours would cook pet fish, just that it is not as expensive as mine,” said Omeychua. “I have given half of the dead fish to my brother. He has eaten it with his son, who said it tasted delicious.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When her koi meal hit the internet on Sunday, it dominated conversation not just on social media, but on news websites across Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Some comments went as far as to associate her culinary efforts with unverified rumours of the coronavirus pandemic originating from exotic animals like bats.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Omeychua has shrugged off the fearmongering, saying she believed it was okay to eat her fish as she had kept them clean. She said the pet koi were still fish and were therefore halal, according to the Islamic faith to which she belongs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While many countries in Asia see brightly coloured koi as a symbol of good luck and fortune, Omeychua clarified that she did not subscribe to such notions and saw fishkeeping as a hobby.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Undeterred by the demise of her ornamental fish and the reaction to her story, Omeychua has since bought 30 more koi – in a mixture of sizes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Maybe if they die, I will try cooking the fish with turmeric and chilli,” she quipped. “And this time, I may film myself eating this fish.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpqaWhufXJ7yK1knJmeYq%2BmecSaq56mXaKura3YrKCapl2svK6tzWaqmrGjYsCpsdJmpahln5mxbrLIrJ9mnJWovarAxA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kerith-burke-wiki-bio-age-engaged-married-parents-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kerith Burke Wiki, Bio, Age, Engaged, Married, Parents</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./glen-powell-sydney-sweeney-seen-body-anyone-but-you-8415447.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Glen Powell Says That &amp;quot;Only&amp;quot; Sydney Sweeney Has Seen Certain Parts of His Body</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
