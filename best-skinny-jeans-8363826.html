Not just from the early 2010s but for decades prior. That’s because skinny jeans are a timeless classic that has transcended generations. That’s right: Leave behind what you know about narrow-legged denim; they’ve been around long before we called them “skinny jeans.” While avant-garde fashion symbols like Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn started wearing tightly fitted, high-waist trousers, iconic names like Dorris Day opted for skinny denim pants, and what began as a counterculture trend quickly became mainstream.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The golden year of skinny jeans arrived in the 2000s, as a surge of as-skinny-as-can-be (and often low-rise) jeans were sported by pop icons like Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, and Nicole Richie, proving their popularity up until the late 2010s when wide-legs took over and flares were revived. Rather than looking at it through the lens of trends, however, the sleek style is more of a closet staple. Plus, since the cyclical fashion cycle, fashion influencers and forecasters <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>are already preparing</a> for their comeback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fashion TikToker <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Marina Mari Maki </a>says the skinny jeans resurgence will look different this time: “This time, they’re going actually to fit you and not be too tight,” she says, noting that pairing skinny jeans will feel updated and refined, too. “You’ll see skinny jeans be more proportioned, like with a looser-fit top or a looser jacket.” It sounds very <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kaia Gerber-inspired</a> — so sign us up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-everlane-the-way-high-skinny-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Way-High Skinny Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Way-High&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg; Skinny Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rWulWbWElmLq8dKJ4ZrfvcwjK44=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-way-high-skinny-jean-be8f4dc35b1d46fd99498e7eb4b4a537.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These jeans are soft but durable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They're extremely high-waisted, reaching above the belly button, which can feel uncomfortable for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everlane, the contemporary and sustainable clothing company, stands at the forefront of accessibility in slow fashion in a fast fashion world. Up against rapidly changing fashion trends, Everlane creates something different—and it excels at it. Each item from its collection is a testament to its commitment to exceptional quality, comfort, and style, with every piece having been meticulously designed with intricate detailing and premium materials. From clean-cut lines to rich leathers, Everlane’s dedication to craftsmanship shines through in every creation, and this pair of denim proves just that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from organic cotton and viscose (a more lightweight and sustainable alternative to polyester), the style balances durability and breathability. Fit-wise, it comes in two lengths, regular and tall. And it's designed to be extremely high-waisted, going so far up above the belly button. This can prove slightly uncomfortable for some, so make sure it’s the right cut for you before purchasing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–35 |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Organic cotton, viscose | <strong>Inseam: </strong>26.75 or 28.75 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-levis-720-high-rise-super-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s 720 High Rise Super Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;acirc;s 720 High Rise Super Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/m38Vi1Yde7N0Fw23jpd4K2GKouY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-720-high-rise-super-skinny-jeans-f8100f6b569744a086ec284023da23ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Leviâs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These super-skinny jeans are stretchy and comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Different washes come with different design details.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Levi's is a classic that's sported by celebs like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Selena Gomez</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Emma Roberts</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kylie Jenner</a>. It's trusted, too, for its reliable fit and reasonable pricing. These ultra-high-rise skinny jeans stay true to that ethos. They’re a flattering, figure-hugging pair that lengthens the legs and curves around your shape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regarding the high-rise in particular, TheBetterFit.com founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">llena Rissa</a> says it lives up to its name. “[The jeans] go to my belly button, so you get a lot of coverage and protection, which I like,” she says, adding that they’re a particularly great summer option given that they’re easy to wear with a crop top. “They also have a good amount of stretch,” she adds. While they may appear skin-tight, they’re comfortable, with a significant amount of breathability, meaning squeezing into your skinny jeans will become a nuisance that will (finally) be left behind. We only wish that all the colors offered come with the same design, but some have distressing up and down the leg and others have contrast stitching on the seams.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–34 |<strong> Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, polyester | <strong>Inseam: </strong>28 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-mother-denim-the-looker-ankle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mother Denim The Looker Ankle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mother Denim The Looker Ankle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-djjqUYKQGC1IOuSCB1XmRdj_Ow=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MOTHER-Denim-The-Looker-Ankle-7e6e4fca0e92468fb707bd5a827012fe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ankle fray makes these look laid-back and cool.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The raw hem hits slightly above the ankle, so it's better for shorter wearers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mother's denim does it again, and again, and again—this time, serving up signature cool-girl vibes in the form of ankle-frayed skinnies. The raw hem hits slightly above the ankle, abiding by a relaxed fit, with an inseam of 27.5 inches. While the brand can sometimes run long, we’ve found that this pair hits perfectly for regular wearers or taller wearers who want more of a cropped skinny style. It also comes with a great amount of stretch, so you’ll never have to feel like stiff toothpicks in it. “I’m a big fan of Mother Denim,” fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Kim Appelt</a> tells InStyle. “I love the cut and the softness.

The figure-flattering detail is due to the jeans’ ultra-stretchy material, rated the “maximum” amount of stretch on Torrid’s denim stretch guide. Not only do these provide an ideal fit in the body, but they also come in a wide range of sizes and lengths. Each pair has precisely measured inseams for extra-short (25”), short (27”), regular (29”), tall (31”), and extra-tall (33”). Plus, they come in sizes 10-30. They’re a great wardrobe staple, especially for those who fall into the petite or tall categories and have trouble finding brands that cater to their body type. But the extensive range in sizing isn’t the only impressive thing about these; despite having tons of stretch, they don’t overly wear out. What we don’t understand, however, is why each color option differs in style and price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>10–30 |<strong> Colors: </strong>10 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, rayon | <strong>Inseam: </strong>25, 27, 29, 31, and 33 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-petites-banana-republic-high-rise-skinny-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best For Petites</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic High-Rise Skinny Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic High-Rise Skinny Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7YG6dBxy5vPzYtWhtCSHQuFIqJ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Banana-Republic-High-Rise-Skinny-Jean-db5ca8aa906348fd8e888720a0118165.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The dark wash looks sophisticated enough to wear to more formal events.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s only available in one wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Banana Republic has been a bit of a go-to for us whenever we need extended sizing in stylish clothing without sacrificing quality. The petite inseam on these pants is 26 inches, which would generally work for anyone under 5 feet, 4 inches tall. The navy wash is super sophisticated, so we’ll forgive the fact that it’s the only color the pants come in. We love that there aren’t any unnecessary design details like frills or distressing, and the camouflaged stitching keeps it a clean canvas to look at. They have a supportive stretch, meaning that these jeans should mold to your body without feeling restricting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–30 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, recycled cotton, elasterrell, elastane | <strong>Inseam: </strong>26 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-height-range-abercrombie--fitch-high-rise-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Height Range</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch High Rise Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch High Rise Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_HWtN5I5y-1jdzUF0_LQOiD422Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/abercrombie--fitch-high-rise-skinny-jeans-4a4ac78a51cc4e16b5e89c0c6a601abf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These come in long and extra long.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There isn’t much stretch to these.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tall women know all too well about the ritual of concealing the short length of a pair of jeans with a boot, lest one’s exposed ankles proclaim a fashion faux pas. But these Abercrombie & Fitch High Rise skinnies should have you covered — literally — with a 29.5-inch and a 31.5-inch inseam.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s quite easy to imagine them with knee-high banana-heeled boots, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">like these from Everlane </a>— and not because you feel like you have to but because you want to. Other standout features include an ankle that isn’t overly skinny but just right (something between a straight-leg and a jegging), eight washes to pick from, and easy-to-navigate sizing on the website. On the other hand, the style isn't as stretchy as some of the past options we highlighted, so it won't necessarily mold to the body or, conversely, offer mobility in a tighter fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–37 |<strong> Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, elastane | <strong>Inseam: </strong>23.5 to 31.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curvy-good-american-good-curve-straight-light-compression-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curvy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good Curve Straight Light Compression Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Curve Straight Light Compression Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5F6BJtbRiukR-pqmOKvyR6svsSc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Good-American-Good-Curve-Straight-Light-Compression-Jeans-f21627d494f4484fa52301ff3318db70.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The inclusive size options.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The denim is on the thinner side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to denim, Good American can do no wrong in our eyes; the label offers flattering silhouettes, an inclusive size range, and sturdy denim fabrics. Enter: the brand's Straight Light Compression jeans. They're cut for wider hips, so they don't create an awkward gap around the waist. Along with their structured look (which includes a versatile and practical five-pocket silhouette), they’re made from a flexible, comfortable denim blend that allows for movement throughout the jeans. This means no more restrictive and rigid denim but a lightweight alternative to all those pesky, uncomfortable jeans in the back of your closet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–28 Plus |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, recycled cotton elastane, polyester | <strong>Inseam: </strong>33.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-rails-larchmont-skinny></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rails Larchmont Skinny</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rails Larchmont Skinny" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HfttJul3cq-H6zdUsaPHFBr-414=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rails-larchmont-skinny-486d42f2dec94f2d8f0825ae9d2ef07d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rails</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These hold their shape.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They run short on taller people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good pair of high-waisted jeans sits just below the torso. A great pair of high-waisted jeans don’t overwhelm the body when they do so. These high-waisted skinnies from Rails happens to be the latter. They’re the ideal size, measuring 10.5 inches in height. We especially love how the high rise doesn’t gape. They earn our top spot, though, mainly because they’ll remain a closet staple for their exceptional fit, quality, and color options. They come in five different washes, ranging from a deep indigo to a pale, faded denim, with a frayed hem and a 3.9-inch leg opening that doesn’t feel too restrictive or airbrushed on; instead, they fit comfortably around the ankle with a touch of breathing room.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–32 |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, polyelastain | <strong>Inseam: </strong>27.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-7-for-all-mankind-bair-kimmie-straight-in-rinsed-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>7 For All Mankind B(air) Kimmie Straight in Rinsed Black</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="7 For All Mankind B(air) Kimmie Straight in Rinsed Black" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9qoHqxKyur1jGuGOR4rqcu3ddyM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/7-for-all-mankind-bair-kimmie-straight-in-rinsed-black-ad1a81e99f7d43a5b618bdc7211a790e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>7 For All Mankind</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>How comfortable these feel.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The inseam is 32 inches without any shorter alternatives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These jeans from 7 For All Mankind strike a harmonious balance, not skin-tight yet not as roomy as traditional straight-cut jeans. We especially love that they have a true mid-rise height, which is sometimes hard to find in a trendscape that favors the high and low rises. All in all, they're reminiscent of denim pants by high-end luxury labels like Khaite and The Row at a much more forgiving price point of $200. We only wish they were offered with more than one 32-inch inseam length, which is generally too long for petites. Wearing them with heels, though, could offer the right amount of lift.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–34 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, lyocell | <strong>Inseam: </strong>32 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-white-frame-le-high-skinny-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frame Le High Skinny</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FRAME Le High Skinny in Blanc" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/d9oF6c8tUPaGv3CjhNwvW5kXkzQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frame-090c40abee7e472aa2f509fac193c793.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>FRAME</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Finally, a non-see-through pair of white jeans.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They aren't offered in more than one inseam length.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shopping for jeans can be complicated. Shopping for white jeans feels even more impossible. These Frame high-rise skinnies, though, make the I need new jeans! panic feel a little less panic-y. That’s because they're so comfortable and flattering with a high waist that generally doesn’t gape at the waist. And for being tightly wrapped skinnies from the waist to the ankle, they are surprisingly opaque, meaning you don’t have to worry about having an accidental see-through moment while wearing them. Having tried several jeans from Frame ourselves, we can attest to how substantial the material feels — thick and warm yet stretchy and flexible. The color is rich and the denim is high-quality, coming in sizes 23–34 and an inseam of 29 inches, which unfortunately is the only length it’s offered in. Plus, if you’re not feeling the white denim moment, there are also three other equally-as-great washes, including two darker washes and a black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–34 |<strong> Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, lyocell, polyester | <strong>Inseam: </strong>29 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-light-wash-rag--bone-nina-ankle-skinny></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Light Wash</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rag & Bone Nina Ankle Skinny</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rag &amp;amp; Bone Nina Ankle Skinny" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iKUrhWEoM37N30vAi_IBfmXsFpk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rag--Bone-Nina-Ankle-Skinny-befb64196584482395df53d68ed44b31.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rag & Bone</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These are the perfect mix of stretch and structure.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The distressed hem can get a little destroyed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All the Jennifers love Rag & Bone — we’re talking <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jennifer Garner</a> — for good reason. The brand specializes in classic Americana looks and thus has perfected denim jeans, making them substantially thick and warm but stretchy enough to easily shimmy into. From all the Rag & Bone jeans we’ve tried, they’ve always magically hugged every curve and never caused any gaping. To be clear, there isn’t any elastane blended into the material, so it's not as elastic as, say, the Good American option, but it’s still very easy to move around in. The only time you need to be careful with these jeans is when you slip them on — because of the distressed hemming, it’s possible your toes get stuck on one of the loose strands and pull them out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>26–34 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, recycled cotton, polyester | <strong>Inseam: </strong>27 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dark-wash-citizens-of-humanity-chrissy-high-rise-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dark Wash</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Citizens of Humanity Chrissy High Rise Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Citizens of Humanity Chrissy High Rise Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kDSW103yHWmjBbhylFkiNHYbhys=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/citizens-of-humanity-chrissy-high-rise-skinny-jeans-5153e467189648dcaef2bade9fbe9c33.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Citizens of Humanity</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re ultra-high rise.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re not as soft as others on this list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might still carry the scars of the unflattering and excessively snug skinny jeans trend of the 2000s, or perhaps you're looking for a more sophisticated and polished alternative to replace your distressed denim collection from that era. In any case, you desire a style that exudes a more mature and luxurious look — and these Citizen of Humanity jeans do just that. They hit the rib cage, so if you’re hunting for a higher waistband and extra comfort, these have you covered. They’re figure-hugging and woven from a brand-specific Sculpt denim, meaning they’re designed to keep their shape wear after wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–24 |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material</strong>: Rayon, cotton | <strong>Inseam: </strong>29 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-medium-wash-ann-taylor-high-rise-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Medium Wash</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ann Taylor High Rise Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ann Taylor High Rise Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4Hu7uXO3yku9YWmPXEy6RPKcQWk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ann-taylor-high-rise-skinny-jeans-c0d25eee1d844fc0adf9f746c18e46ab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ann Taylor</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These come in petite and regular-length options.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There's no tall-specific sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s no secret that InStyle editors love Ann Taylor: Its refined, luxurious designs are the kind that never go out of style, just like a faithful pair of medium-wash denim. This pair from the brand is designed with sculpting pockets to flatter and hold your shape — and also has a performance stretch that supports and shapes the body. Plus, if you’re on the shorter side, there's a petite length of 26-inch inseam, while regular runs at 28 inches. We just wish there was a tall option for those who'd need it. On the material: There’s just enough stretch, and the fit is very flattering (it doesn't have a painted-on look despite being form-fitted). Instead of being pin-thin, there's a little more room around the legs, not unlike a cousin to the straight-leg silhouette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–18 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, recycled polyester | <strong>Inseam: </strong>26 or 28 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Stretch</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skinny jeans often contain stretchy materials like spandex or elastane for them to hold that figure-hugging component we are looking for.

You wouldn’t want to rock too long of a denim with a must-be-seen bootie, would you? Exactly. A way to check that your denim is the right length is through the inseam measurement. The inseam measurement ensures the pants are the right length for your legs. A correctly measured inseam will result in pants that aren’t too long and aren’t too short. Many brands, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ann Taylor</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Levi’s</a>, have petite and tall inseams, catering to people who wouldn’t regularly fit classic lengths. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> takes it one step further and offers pants for extra tall ladies fitted for women who are taller than 5 feet, 11 inches.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What shoes look best with skinny jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skinny jeans are entirely versatile because of what they can be paired with — which feels like everything and anything.

While baggier options have become pop culture’s favorite trend as of late, don’t forget that these are just styles brought back from the late ’90s and early 2000s. You can expect, therefore, that skinny jeans that ruled in 2010 are set to come back into full swing. Even now, however, the sleek style perfect for boots and high heels is still very much en vogue.
