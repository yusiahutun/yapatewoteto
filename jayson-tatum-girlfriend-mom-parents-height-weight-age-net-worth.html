Like many others, he has become a person of interest to many people. The young ballerina plays professional basketball for the Boston Celtics.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Jayson Tatum biography and age</strong></h2><p>Basketball star Jayson Christopher Tatum was born on March 3, 1998, in St. Louis Missouri. He was raised as a single child by his mother Brandy Cole but now he has a younger brother Jaycob Tatum and a sister Kayden.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Jayson-Tatum.jpg fetchpriority=high decoding=async alt="Jayson Tatum Girlfriend, Mom, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Net WorthJayson Tatum Girlfriend, Mom, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth" width=965 height=541 title="Jayson Tatum Girlfriend, Mom, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth" data-sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>For his studies, the star of Saint-Louis attended the preparatory school of Chaminade College before continuing his studies at Duke University. In high school and university, he played a very important role.</p><p>Looking back at his career he started very early and when he finished high school he earned almost everything he could and ended up as a five-star recruit. After he moved to university it only took him one season to make the <a href=#>NBA draft</a>. In the season alone he helped the Duke Blue Devils win the CCA tournament championship.</p><p>It was, as reported in 2017 that he made the NBA project after signing for the Celtics where he was made tall for himself having broken <a href=#>Larry Bird</a> records to become the first Celtics rookie to score 20 points as long as 5 straight playoff games as well as the first to score 25 points or more in a playoff game. Most importantly he was able to help the Celtics reach the 2018 NBA playoffs. He represented the United States at the FIBA U19 World Championship in 2015 and the FIBA U17 World Championship in 2014, helping teams win the gold medal.</p><h2><strong>Jayson Tatum </strong><strong>Girlfriend, Mom, parents</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Jayson-Tatum.jpg><p>His mother had him when she was only 19 and she fought to raise him. At one time they lived in a house without furniture. She was about to go to university when she found out she was pregnant but she gave birth to him and continued her studies with many details about the struggles they both went through.</p><p>What is very interesting is that even though his parents were not together his father was always there for him. In fact like many other basketball stars who stand on the wings of their loved ones young Tatum got up with the help of his father Justin Tatum who taught him the game, and his hard work was not exaggerated. Justin Tatum is a basketball coach at Christian Brothers College High School.</p><p>Jayson’s two younger siblings Jaycob and Kayden are from his father’s other relationships. Nevertheless, Jayson is very close to his brothers and sisters and shares their photos on social media.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Jayson-Tatum-Girlfriend-1.jpg decoding=async alt="Jayson Tatum Girlfriend, Mom, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth" width=748 height=517 title="Jayson Tatum Girlfriend, Mom, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth" data-sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Although he is a baller on the court Jayson Tatum also seems to be the same off the court. He has been linked to more than one woman in the past. That said his current girlfriend is <strong>Samie Amos</strong>. The two met at the university during Samie’s second year. Like her boyfriend, she is also a sportsman because she plays on Duke’s volleyball team. Her real name is Samantha Taylor Amos and she was born on September 26, 1997.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Jayson-Tatum-and-Wife-Toriah-Lachell.jpg decoding=async alt="Jayson Tatum Girlfriend, Mom, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth" width=854 height=510 title="Jayson Tatum Girlfriend, Mom, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth" data-sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Apart from Samie Amos Jayson Tatum was also related to another woman Toriah Lachell.
