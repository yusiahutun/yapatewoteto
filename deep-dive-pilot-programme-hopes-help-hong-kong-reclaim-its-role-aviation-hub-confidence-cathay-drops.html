Law, a senior adviser from CUHK, mentioned that previous attempts to establish other local airlines were unsuccessful due to the limited market size and resources. Being the longest-established airline in Hong Kong since its founding in 1946, Cathay Pacific has gradually grown to become the dominant flag carrier through years of dedication and effort. Therefore, introducing a second carrier may not be a feasible way to solve the problems faced by the city’s aviation industry.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Having more airlines could introduce competition and provide passengers with additional options, but talent and resource shortages would make it difficult to sustain a new airline in the current market. The existing manpower shortage faced by Cathay Pacific indicates the challenges in recruiting and retaining skilled workers. Additionally, the allocation of limited airport resources and airspace capacity could pose further constraints on the viability of a second flag carrier.
