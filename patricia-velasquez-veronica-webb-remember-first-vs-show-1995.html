She was the first black model to land a cosmetics contract, hit the catwalk for every major designer from Chanel to Helmut Lang— and landed a coveted spot on the first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show runway at 30 years old. Now 51, Webb is still balancing a modeling career (she appeared in the Yeezy Season 3 show) along with motherhood, and her own website <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.webbonthefly.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Webb on the Fly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Webb on the Fly</a>. Webb will be attending the 21st Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Paris. Here, she recalls what the 1995 VSFS was really like.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This was definitely the era of the major fashion show—every model in 1995 wanted the same thing: Victoria's Secret and a cosmetics contact. Victoria's Secret was one of the most challenging bookings I ever got. The show is so beautiful, so iconic, and demands that every girl who walks the show be at her absolute physical peak. Two of the greatest things for me, as someone who really cares about health, and setting fitness goals, were VS and being a mother. That really kicked my fitness into high gear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've been doing the same workout forever, I just add in a new sport every year to keep my brain young, like barre classes and boxing workouts. I've been distance running for years, I keep it at a very slow pace. In '95 I learned to rollerblade, I took them to Paris, and skated between every show.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Now, when I look, back I'm like, 'I never knew I looked that good!'"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There was no casting for the show like there is today, the VS casting process back then starts the minute you become a model of a certain stature, thats good at walking the runway. The agents just know, and the models know, get ready because the day that your name gets called, you better be able to answer. It's always in the back of your mind like... stay fit, stay ready and keep raising the bar for my fitness goals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I remember thinking, I'm never gonna be able to pull this off, they don't see what I see; there's something wrong with them or they just don't want to hurt my feelings. Now, when I look back I'm like, I never knew I looked that good! Not to toot my own horn, just that as women we're always so hard on ourselves. Also it's a testament to good hair and makeup that really brought out the best in us.</p><img alt="Head, Human body, Shoulder, Fashion show, Dress, Runway, Style, Waist, Fashion model, Fashion, " title="Head, Human body, Shoulder, Fashion show, Dress, Runway, Style, Waist, Fashion model, Fashion, " width=2146 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/47/1480169314-gettyimages-139655710.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The VS show was definitely risqué. For as many years as I have been in the business, anytime you have to wear swimwear or lingerie, its always somewhat embarrassing. So to be wearing that, in a room of people wearing jeans and T-shirts, there's a certain mental barrier you have to cross, in order to walk down the runway, and not get caught up in every flaw you might have.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But it's such a great escape. The girls are so beautiful and I appreciate the discipline that it takes for a girl to make it to that runway, and how special that is. Adriana Lima has been holding the crown for so long now. I love seeing girls coming down the runway now with natural hair, where it's super short and beautiful, ebony complexion. In my day most girls came with their own hair extensions, and you had to come tan. More than ever, people are embracing diversity. I love the idea of diversity, because it unites people. The more different we are, and that we can all come together, the better off we'll all be. It'll be interesting to see if someone super curvy comes down the runway, like Ashley Graham, I'd love to see that.</p><img alt="Face, Nose, Arm, Mouth, Human body, Drinkware, Hand, Glass, Stemware, Barware, " title="Face, Nose, Arm, Mouth, Human body, Drinkware, Hand, Glass, Stemware, Barware, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480407905-hbz-veronica-webb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was 30 at that first show, you feel like your career is going to be over, but now 20-something years later I'm still working. All those things that you learn in fashion, runway walking, and the discipline it takes to be involved in a multi-billion dollar business like that, translate into another career.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="article-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Patricia Velasquez</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After three years of college, the Venezuelan native took off for Milan in pursuit of a modeling career. Often lauded as the first Latina supermodel, Velasquez hit the runways for Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, Claude Montana, held a contract with Covergirl and L'Oreal—but it was her work with Victoria's Secret and Sports Illustrated that took her career to the next level. She began studying acting in Los Angeles and New York in the late '90s and began appearing in films like "Le Jaguar" and "The Mummy". Velasquez then launched her own beauty brand, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hsn.com/shop/taya-beauty-beauty/bs-8132 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Taya Beauty" data-vars-ga-product-id=e488dee8-d922-4040-b964-c49eb08c4e5a data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://www.hsn.com/shop/taya-beauty-beauty/bs-8132 data-product-url=http://www.hsn.com/shop/taya-beauty-beauty/bs-8132 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://hsn.uqhv.net/c/3006986/565524/9378?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsn.com%2Fshop%2Ftaya-beauty-beauty%2Fbs-8132&subId1=har&subid3=xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"072bf9bc-3d0a-4445-99f5-c8f216b29cf1","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"67431","merchant_name":"HSN","network_name":"IR","network_id":"3","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://hsn.uqhv.net/c/3006986/565524/9378?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsn.com%2Fshop%2Ftaya-beauty-beauty%2Fbs-8132&subId1={subid}","network_name":"ir","appended_link":"https://hsn.uqhv.net/c/3006986/565524/9378?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsn.com%2Fshop%2Ftaya-beauty-beauty%2Fbs-8132&subId1={subid}&subid3=xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-06-18 04:52:05.657906"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=9dfdf80e-dd25-4c76-8ad6-570838be0fc4 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Taya Beauty</a>.

There was a lot of buzz, and expectations—what was is it going to be? Personally, I had worked with Victorias Secret a lot. It was always a very chic and intimate environment when you shot with them—you always felt safe, the photos were beautiful. When I first heard about the show though, I remember being a little skeptical, and worried. We weren't going to have the best photographers there to make sure we looked good— it was just going to be as you were. I found out about the show maybe a week and a half, two weeks maximum. There was no time to prepare. We had to be as skinny as we could—we were all very thin, of course.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lingerie shows were not something that we were doing at the time. In the end we agreed because Victoria's Secret was such a great client— we trusted them that it would be fine. I remember the show was very carefully done: the lighting was beautiful, music and there were a lot of models, you only had one exit. It wasn't cheesy or over the top—it ended up being a really, really fun, high-energy show. I was very happy to be apart of it. I think it was a little scandalous at the time, all the supermodels walking on the runway in lingerie. I know I had an outfit where I wasn't showing my butt though, I think I had something around it covering it up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When you worked as a model, there was a straight path of the things you wanted to achieve in your career. You did editorials, fashion shows, campaigns, sometimes a chic catalog shoot—but there was a disconnect between that high fashion world and mainstream media. Once you achieved a certain status you would work with Victoria's Secret and Sports Illustrated. They came hand in hand. The fact that VS did this fashion show brought the two worlds together. I noticed a change in my career with the bookings I was getting after walking in the first show—I got the cover of Maxim, and Esquire. Covers models wouldn't really normally do, we became more well known.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Unfortunately, the message we're putting out there is youth equals beauty. I come from a culture where wrinkles are beauty."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don't really pay attention to the models now. Of course I know Gigi Hadid, though, I just watched her on the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/news/g8173/gigi-hadid-amas-2016/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=AMAs class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">AMAs</a>—I have a 10-year-old daughter, so that's who she is looking at. I think the industry is much more open to diversity now. It used to be the blacks, the Asians and Latin girls all in one pot, and the caucasians in the other. When I crossed over to mainstream, Covergirl was one of the first companies to give me a job—I became one of their main girls in the American market, they took a risk on me. The business has changed tremendously in terms of age— in our time, the age of the supermodels, we were older. Now the look is younger, and this is something I really struggle with. I don't have issues with my age, weight or wrinkles. Unfortunately, the message we're putting out there is youth equals beauty. I come from a culture where wrinkles are beauty.</p><img alt="Clothing, Leg, Dress, Photograph, White, Happy, Summer, Facial expression, Style, One-piece garment, " title="Clothing, Leg, Dress, Photograph, White, Happy, Summer, Facial expression, Style, One-piece garment, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480436484-hbz-patricia-velasquez-tyra-banks.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've watched bits of the fashion show over the past few years. With reality shows, and things like social media, you have to work really hard at getting people's attention. A fashion show in itself isn't the most interesting thing to watch—but the beautiful girls, the bodies, the big wings—it works. You almost have to shock them, and that's what the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show does.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/6596416d-7fe0-4447-a1bb-29857d998209_1532371556.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chrissy Rutherford" title="Headshot of Chrissy Rutherford" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Chrissy Rutherford is a contributing editor at HarpersBazaar.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiln5myrb%2BOp5ywq1%2BWfnp8kXJmqZmkp7aktcBmrZ6kkai%2BtrHZZq2eqp%2BjtqStjLCcm5pdp7KuscybnKtllp6%2FtMCMr6pmq5ikxG59mHJsaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wonderskin-lip-stain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wonderskin Lip Stain Is Going Viral on TikTok for How Long It Lasts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-poppins-bright-star-glynis-johns-dies-its-a-somber-day-in-hollywood.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Poppins' 'bright star' Glynis Johns dies - It's a 'somber day in Hollywood'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
