I let all the deadlines pass, I took the LSAT, it was December 1998, everything passed. There was no way saying I was going to law school. Then I got a letter out of the blue in the mail in February from Georgetown Law, saying that the deadlines have expired but we will extend it for you if you apply by March 15. I sent off that application, got in, two weeks later I decided to go."&nbsp;</p><p id=e2IRBvZ7uK data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jenna Bush Hager reveals baby news, but husband Henry Hager won't be happy</a></p><p id=e2vJ9gX2gFI data-wc=13>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Savannah Guthrie's huge announcement is teased - as fans go into overdrive</a></p><p id=eWrCcIITD6 data-wc=37>The news anchor was then asked by Brooke: "After huge success, at Georgetown Law, you decided to pivot back to journalism..."

He said, 'come in and see me'.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHhPqVX8Uw data-wc=50>"I tried to explain to him that I had this dream, and it's what I want to do, and he asked me if I had a job offer. I said 'No sir.' He said 'Do you have any leads or prospects, why now?' And I said 'No, I have nothing.'"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5a7ba1cd9e43-today-anchors-pink-outfits.jpg><p id=esJM1vbeCl data-wc=37>She continued: "He said 'I get it, it's your dream. Why don't you come and do this clerkship and then do it afterwards, it's only a year. You're only going to be enhanced by this experience.'" "</p><p id=eDFAhfmYuM data-wc=38>And I said 'judge, I know you are right, this makes perfect sense. But I know myself, and if I don't do it now, I'm never going to have the courage again.' And so he just said 'Okay'."&nbsp;</p><p id=ehYwIl5EME data-wc=51>Of course, Savannah certainly made the right decision for her, now with an impressive broadcasting career under her belt, which has seen her travel the world. Just this year alone, she's gone to London and Paris for work, covering the coronation of King Charles for NBC and many more high-profile events.</p><p id=eV453Htk6s data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
