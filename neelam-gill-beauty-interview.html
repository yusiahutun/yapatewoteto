"One of the best tips I’ve picked up on set is to learn about your undertones," she explains. "This is essential to figuring out which foundation shades and make-up colours complement your skin tone, and which wash you out."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to her signature beauty look, she often gravitates towards an exaggerated cat-eye with thick, brushed-up brows ("I'm Punjabi, so it's in the genes!") and a nude lip. "But it's my version of a nude," she tells Bazaar. "I find that a lot of typical nude lipsticks really wash my skin tone out, so my nude is normally more of a pinky brown or a mauve. Sometimes I mix two or three shades together to find one that suits me."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Neelam Gill at the 2023 Venice Film Festival" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/1d2985b9-a43c-4b6a-9c46-1ef3f8083d95/thumb_1280x720_00001_1695801620_31170.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, the model tells us about her beauty favourites, what self-care means to her, and why true beauty comes from within...</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">On her skincare journey...</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I suffered from cystic acne a few years ago and it really impacted my confidence.

That was the first time I ever experimented with make-up, really. When I was growing up, I couldn't find find foundation in my shade, so I'd always just focus on my eyes. I was obsessed with having super long lashes. Because I also wasn't allowed to wear much make-up at the time. But I used to try all the drugstore brands, but I remember specifically using Rimmel and L'Oreal products and just layering different mascaras on top of each other – starting with one that's good for curling and then ending with one that's good for length. I basically had this whole routine for my lashes."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The foundation she takes with her everywhere...</h2><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£46 at LookFantastic for Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation" data-href=https://www.lookfantastic.com/armani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades/11918789.html data-product-url=https://www.lookfantastic.com/armani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades/11918789.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lookfantastic.com%2Farmani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades%2F11918789.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£46 at LookFantastic" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lookfantastic.com/armani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades/11918789.html data-vars-ga-product-brand="Scalp Care" data-vars-ga-product-id=0fd6c3fc-d549-40a2-abdc-c4fe630f2b47 data-vars-ga-product-price=£46.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2bd87128-b1d5-4079-8787-7fd62bd817f4 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Scalp Care" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=lookfantastic_11918789 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation" title="Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1695745095-11918789-1904937137219332.jpg width=1500 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lookfantastic.com/armani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades/11918789.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="[Giorgio Armani] Luminous Silk" data-vars-ga-product-id=fb2fceb7-08fa-474f-8518-bcbfbb957df9 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.lookfantastic.com/armani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades/11918789.html data-product-url=https://www.lookfantastic.com/armani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades/11918789.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lookfantastic.com%2Farmani-luminous-silk-foundation-30ml-various-shades%2F11918789.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=nars data-vars-ga-product-price=£36.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=057338d9-e9fc-489a-b24b-527143203485 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=nars data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Foundation class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">[Giorgio Armani] Luminous Silk</a> was the first foundation I tried that really matched my skin tone, and I also really like the finish that it has on my skin. It has great coverage but it still feels like your skin, whereas other foundations... I've tried so many in the past and I will always have to mix multiple shades together to get the perfect shade for me, which is difficult when you're travelling and you already have so many products in your toiletry bag. With Luminous Silk, I really like the feel of it on my skin and I like that it's not too heavy, but you can also build coverage if needs be. But it was the shade range for me that was a game-changer; that's what drew me to it. I would carry it in my own kit when I first started modelling and take it on set with me, just incase the make-up artist didn't have the right shade for me – sometimes they might have a shade that has a weird undertone on my skin. It's really been my go-to now for so many years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's basically a universal brown girl product!

Then I would generally go for a nude lip, but it's my version of a nude. I find that a lot of typical nude lipsticks really wash my skin tone out, so my nude is normally more of a pinky brown or a mauve shade.

This is essential to figuring out which foundation shades and lipstick colours complement your skin tone, and which wash you out."</p><h2 data-node-id=49 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">On beauty as a form of self expression...</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My industry has taught me the joy of self expression and creativity. For example, if I’m feeling assertive and businesslike, I’ll keep my make-up natural and pull my hair into a slicked bun. When I want to feel more girly and ethereal, I love letting my hair down and playing with blush or highlight.

Even if I’m wearing no make-up and haven’t styled my hair, I feel my best after laying out reading in the sun all day and swimming in the sea. The sun and water are two of the most powerful sources of energy and inspiration."</p><h2 data-node-id=56 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">On her personal beauty philosophy...</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My personal beauty philosophy has always remained the same as it’s what I was raised on: that true beauty comes from within. It doesn’t matter how you look on the outside, you could be physically beautiful, but what matters is how you treat others and how you make them feel.
