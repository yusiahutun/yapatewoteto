The basketball star comes from a family of renowned female ballplayers, and since she started playing basketball at a young age, she has earned a reputation as one of the most decorated basketball players of all time.</p><p>She has earned several awards and recognitions, including an MVP award for the WNBA Final, a WNBA Championship, two National Championships, two MVP awards from the regular WNBA season, two Olympic gold medals, a Naismith College Player of the Year award, and several other unlisted awards and recognitions.</p><h2><strong>Husband, Divorce, Daughter, Brother</strong></h2><p>When we talked about how the basketball star got a foothold in the sports industry, we found out that her whole family loves basketball. Her father Larry Parker played the game in the past, but one of her brothers, Anthony Parker, currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA. According to Anthony Parker, he is the best basketball player in the Parker family. Her second brother Marcus Parker is a doctor by profession.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Candace-Parker-Daughter.jpg><p>The basketball superstar is a divorced, single mother of a son; she was married to ex-basketball player Shelden Williams, who played for Duke University, the couple got married on November 13, 2008, in Lake Tahoe, California, after many months of courtship, and the following year, on May 13, 2009, they had a girl named Lailaa Nicole Williams. The couple seemed happy in their marriage for seven whole years, but it seemed that the tables turned against Candace Parker in 2015 when her husband beat her divorce papers and demanded a spousal settlement and joint custody of their daughter Lailaa. According to Williams, they have been separated for some time and have been living apart since August; he just wanted to make things official as their differences were irreconcilable.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Maite Perroni Bio, Her Childhood, Family Life, Acting Career and Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>Shelden Williams’ career in the NBA spanned six seasons, and he has made a total of $12 million during his active years in basketball, but he is asking Candace Parker to provide tremendous support for his spouse and also expects her to take care of his legal bills. By all indications, the court seems to have ruled in William’s favor and he will receive a fat alimony check for $400,000 from his ex-wife. Candace, for her part, has agreed to pay the alimony but has refused to honor the payment of ongoing spousal support. The couple also sold their house in Encino, CA, for the sum of $4,390,000 and divided the profit among themselves.</p><p>In the case of their daughter Lailaa, there is agreement on joint legal and physical custody, neither of them paying alimony for the child, but her education and the costs of her care are shared between the two parents. Despite her busy schedule, the WNBA star has found a way to stay close to her daughter, especially when she is absent for long periods of time. They make homemade sleeping calendars, and every night while she is on the phone with her daughter, they cross out a day together, which is a way of saying a day that is closer to seeing each other.</p><h2><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>It is expected that a basketball player is very tall, and Candace Parker is no exception, the basketball player stands at a great height of 1.93 m (1.93 m) with a corresponding weight of 82 kg. The details of her other body statistics are not known to the public, but her African-American background has given her black hair and black eyes. The basketball star also has several tattoos on various parts of her body; on her left wrist, she has an inscription that says: “To whom much is given, much is expected of him,” and on her right wrist there is a key that matches the lock on Williams’ (her husband’s) wrist. It is on record that there is a third key on her lower back, perhaps a secret one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Candace-Parker.jpg><h2><strong>Salary, What Does Candace Parker Earn?</strong></h2><p>The current net worth of the Los Angeles Sparks Forward was set at $2 million by a reliable source. The beautiful basketball player has earned her fortune from the salaries she has earned from basketball over the years and sponsorship contracts she has with some multinational companies like Adidas.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sebastian Vettel Wife, Daughter, Family, Height, Age, Salary, Bio</a></strong></p><p>When she played for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg in 2015, for example, she earned an annual salary of $1,200,000, the sponsorship money she received from several companies amounted to $3 million annually, and her own share of the proceeds from the sale of the house she owned with her ex-husband, which was sold for $4,390,000, also contributed significantly to the athlete’s net worth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKK6w5qanmWglr%2BssdFmn66rkpa7pXnDoq2oqpOaeqWt1KCfrZ2iYq%2Bzu9OhnKtlmJq2qLTTZqqapJGnxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gemma-styles-wiki-bio-facts-about-harry-styles-sisternet-worth-boyfriend-age-height-family-nationality-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gemma Styles- Wiki, Bio &amp;amp; Facts About Harry Styles Sister,Net Worth, Boyfriend, Age, Height, Fami</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./19-intriguing-facts-about-danny-woodburn.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>19 Intriguing Facts About Danny Woodburn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
