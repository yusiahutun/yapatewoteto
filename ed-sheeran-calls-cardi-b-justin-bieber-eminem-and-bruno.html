On No. 6 Collaborations Project, released yesterday, Sheeran convenes some of pop’s biggest names – including <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cardi B</span></a>, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Justin Bieber</span></a>, Travis Scott, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Eminem</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Bruno Mars</span></a> – for an album as precisely rendered as any Sheeran has made.The result, in no small part, is a flex: a demonstration of whom Sheeran can get in the studio (and bumps into backstage). But it’s also meant to showcase the widening creative scope of a one-time folky who’s come a long way since his teenage days worshipping <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Damien Rice</span></a>.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Then, lo and behold, he produces this incredible arrangement for the showAtlantic UK president Ben Cook on how Sheeran adapts his songs for his concerts</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There’s Caribbean-accented dance-pop, glowing R&B balladry, even a Sunset Strip hair-metal jam – enough variety to lead Howard to say, “I don’t think there’s anybody else in the world that could make credible music with this range of artists in this many styles.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Howard notes, No. 6 Collaborations Project started taking shape during Sheeran’s global tour behind ÷, which Billboard identified as the highest-grossing road show of 2018, with ticket sales of US$429 million. (The new album’s title calls back to No. 5 Collaborations Project, a 2011 EP on which Sheeran, a lover of hip-hop – and an occasional rapper – long before now, recruited grime MCs such as Wiley and Sway.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Cook, the singer was itching to release new music but wanted to work outside the pattern he’d set with the chart-topping ÷ and his previous two solo albums, 2014’s x and his double-platinum 2011 debut, +. That he was “bouncing across the world”, as Cook put it, lent itself to the record’s hit-and-run approach.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In South America he got turned on to Paulo Londra, a young Latin trap phenom from Argentina, who guests on the track Nothing on You. And in Nashville he and Chris Stapleton, the burly country singer, got the ball rolling on a song that eventually became the hard-rocking Blow which also features Mars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">(Sheeran’s original idea for the similarly flexible Mars, Cook said, was “this kind of Lady Marmalade” that would have teamed the two with Bieber, who instead ended up duetting with Sheeran on the album’s lead single, I Don’t Care.)</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Skrillex</span></a> was one artist Sheeran was especially eager to work with, according to Howard, who said, “Ed loves pure old-school dubstep mixed with songwriting and guitars”; the EDM star made Way to Break My Heart with Sheeran and also co-produced Take Me Back to London, featuring British rapper Stormzy.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Best Part of Me, a duet with up-and-coming soul singer Yebba, is an outlier on No. 6 – “more of a traditional Ed Sheeran song,” as Howard said, with plucked acoustic guitar and a lyric about a guy whose “hair is thinning, falling out of all the wrong places”. But its inclusion reflects Sheeran’s understanding that what he is selling isn’t merely the sounds of the moment; he knows how powerfully he combines his awkward relatability with his savant-level skills.</p>Other featured guests include Ella Mai, Camila Cabello, H.E.R., 50 Cent, Meek Mill, Young Thug and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Khalid</span></a>, the last of whom helps open the album with the pulsating Beautiful People. It’s not the only tune here in which Sheeran – who gives a slyly funny performance <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">as a version of himself in Danny Boyle’s new movie, Yesterday</span></a> – describes feeling anxious about the way celebrity can sand down a person’s idiosyncrasies.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked about his aspirations for No. 6, Howard said he hopes that, with “so much noise around Ed”, the album refocuses attention on the singer’s music. Yet Cook was clear about his desire to reach new audiences – fans of Latin pop, for instance, who might be attracted by Londra’s participation. The label president happily pointed out that Blow also was getting played on rock radio stations, a first for Sheeran, who typically dominates Top 40 and Hot AC playlists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And what about supporting the record on the road? Little about No. 6, with its varied textures and many moving parts, would seem to lend itself to the stripped-down style of Sheeran’s concerts. Cook said the singer himself, who has dates scheduled in Europe through the end of August, said the same thing about Shape of You, his slinky club track from 2017.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Then, lo and behold, he produces this incredible arrangement for the show,” Cook said. “So I don’t know how he’ll do it. But he’ll find a way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2Fj2pvbGhmZLKledKhnJ6qkaN6pK3Lpapmm5Gnsap5wWahrquknrtursiemZ6qXZq6qrrEpmSappRir7PBzag%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./299982-martin-lawrence-net-worth-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Martin Lawrence net worth in 2020</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./back-future-heres-4-hoverbikes-you-can-actually-fly-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Back to the Future?
