This value is highlighted through our dedicated financial advisors who are not only building better tomorrows for their clients, but also for their communities,” said Steve Radke, president of the Northwestern Mutual Foundation. “Through their philanthropic work, our advisors are donating their time and talents to help local nonprofit organizations.”</p><p>Empower House QCA (at 131 W. 2nd St., Suite 305, Davenport) has built a community focused on empowering others and inspiring a more purposeful life after brain injury by working with rehab professionals to provide a Clubhouse for survivors.</p><p>At the Clubhouse, activities are organized to improve productivity and independent living for those that have survived major brain injuries. Peeler regularly volunteers at Empower House QCA to spend time with members and help organize events and fundraisers.</p><p>“My goal is to show everyone that no matter what you’ve been through, it’s up to you to control your outlook on life. I enjoy being a part of this inspirational and positive community and am honored to see how Empower House is making a difference every day,” said Peeler. “This grant from Northwestern Mutual’s Community Service Awards program will help fund new equipment, additional fundraisers and day-to-day expenses.”</p><p>Empower House offers survivors of brain injury the opportunity to maintain skills/daily activities that they might rapidly lose if they aren’t consistently working on them. Daily activities such as helping plan events, answering the phone, ordering groceries, etc. are often times the things we take for granted, and they spend time making sure they never lose the ability to do it themselves.</p><p>They also provide social and recreational programs to their members, and even host a monthly Aphasia Group to the public in partnership with a Genesis speech-language pathologist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/02/tannerpeeler.png><p>Growing up, Peeler had a handful of brain-related sports injuries, leading to struggles with migraines and progressing symptoms. These experiences have made him appreciate Empower House even more, and he remains grateful that he can help those who battle even larger struggles.</p><p>The $15,000 check to Empower House from the Northwestern Mutual Foundation will be used mostly for daily operations including rent, utilities, groceries, and supplies. The funds will also allow Empower House to continue to keep their low membership fees, so no family is turned away.</p><p>Now in its 29th year, Northwestern Mutual, through its Foundation and Community Service Awards program, has donated nearly $7 million to nonprofits supported by financial professionals in their communities across the country.</p><p>For more information on Empower House, <a href=#>click HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKWoqqSdxKa%2F056pp2WdqsG2rctmnquZnql6qbHLqapmnZ2lvLix0WafqK2jmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./penny-lancaster-melts-hearts-rod-stewart-lookalike-sons.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Penny Lancaster melts hearts with gorgeous photo of Rod Stewart's lookalike sons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-chesney-comments-beyonce-cma-awards-performance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenny Chesney Comments on Beyonce's CMA Awards Performance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
