while others hit the dust!</p><p style=text-align:justify>Famous rapper and American musician Flavor Flav can explain that to you better, as his relationship with his wife hit a rocky road too.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But, their relationship was strong enough to withstand the troubles, and today the couple enjoys thirteen years-long relationship.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Let's take a stroll in his life as he enjoys a laid-back life with his wife and kid while we address the past troubles of their relationship.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Flavor Flav’s Life with His Wife</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The American musician got&nbsp;engaged&nbsp;to Liz Trujillo back in 2008.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-191

talk show back in May 2016.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But, the musician and his wife now seem to have broken off and officially called it <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quits</a>.&nbsp;However, this sometimes sweet, sometimes salty relationship has its own tale.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>While Flavor maintained a low-key life, fans were uncertain about his relationship with his wife, Liz Trujillo.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Thus, a while ago, he shared that he and his wife are still together and gave an insight into his married life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-192 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>In an interview in May 2016, the American musician revealed the information saying,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>My son Karma, he’s nine years old right now, you know what I’m saying? And my girl, she’s at home, she’s just chilling. But yes, we’re still together after twelve years. You know what I’m saying? So I’m not mad.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Flavor and his wife enjoy marital bliss now, but the couple went through a rough patch in the past. The couple appeared on the VH1 show 'Couple’s Therapy'&nbsp;in 2013 when they were still engaged.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In the show, Liz confessed that the lowest point in their relationship was the incident when she discovered that the American Musician had signed the contract for a dating show without her&nbsp;knowledge.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Find Out About Female Rapper's Life:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Azealia Banks Boyfriend, Dating, Gay, Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>In an interview in June 2013, Flavor's ex-wife revealed how she found out about Flavor's new show, stating,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>We were already together for eight months in a committed relationship, and we’re in a deli and the guy is like ‘Congratulations Flav, on your new show and finding true love and dating 25 beautiful women.’ I looked at him and I was like ‘A new show, what?

I don’t understand.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In April 2013, Flavor Flav's fiancee, Liz Trujillo, collapsed during the filming of 'Couples Therapy'&nbsp;and was hospitalized&nbsp;after&nbsp;ODing on painkillers.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-193 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The incident was initially claimed to&nbsp;be an accidental overdose, but Flavor's&nbsp;spokesperson denied it by quoting, "The claim of an overdose, or any involvement of drugs, could not be further from the truth."</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Flavor Flav's Visit to Jail</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Another dent occurred in the duo's relationship&nbsp;when Flavor chased his then-fiancee, Liz's son, Karma, with a kitchen knife at Flavor’s Las Vegas home in October 2012.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>In 2000, he lived in the cramped Bronx apartment of his then-girlfriend, Beverly Johnson (along with her two kids from a previous relationship), in a rough area near Yankee Stadium.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-194 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The American musician admitted that he threatened him, for which he would have been put behind bars for 12 years on the felony assault charges, but the court reduced it to misdemeanor offenses at the last minute as Flav reconciled with his family, as per reports on April 2014.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was sentenced to probation and four months of domestic violence counseling by the Clark County District Court.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt="American Musician Flavor Flav with his Wife and Family" height=333 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/Flavor%20Flav%2C%20Karma%20Drayton%2C%20Liz%20Trujillo%20and%20Gibran%20Trujillo.jpg width=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Flavor Flav's wife and kids&nbsp;(Photo: nydailynews.com)</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite experiencing bitter incidents in the past, the couple has emerged victorious and are still going strong as a couple.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Flavor Flav's Past Relationships</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Previously Flav was married to&nbsp;Karen Ross, with whom he shares his first three children.
