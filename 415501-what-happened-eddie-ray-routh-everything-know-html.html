The <i>American Sniper </i>is an award-winning film that follows the life of Chris Kyle. It is based on Chris's memoir <i>American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History </i>(2012). The film is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Jason Hall.</p><h2>Who is Eddie Ray Routh?</h2><p class=align-left>Eddie was born on September 30, 1987, in Lancaster, Texas, United States. He is 34 years old as of 2021. The names of his parents are Raymond Ray Routh Sr. and Jodi Routh. Eddie grew up alongside his sister Laura Bess Routh. After completing his high school <a href=#>education</a>, he joined the Marine Corps.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jana Reynolds's story: What really happened and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2007, he was deployed to a base near Baghdad, where he served as the prison guard and repaired weapons. He was also deployed to the humanitarian mission in Haiti. In July 2011, he was discharged from the Marine Corps after serving for seven years.</p><h2>Did Eddie Ray Routh have PTSD?</h2><p class=align-left>Within a year after being discharged, Eddie's life was falling apart. He had trouble keeping a job and began behaving erratically, having panic attacks and saying crazy, delusional things. He experienced auditory hallucinations and even threatened to kill himself. Alarmed, his <a href=#>family</a> members took away his guns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg><p class=align-left>Eddie was admitted to the Veterans Administration hospital in Dallas in July 2011, where he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Doctors prescribed a raft of antipsychotic and anti-anxiety drugs, but he declined the treatment offered at the inpatient facility and stopped taking medications after being discharged.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28b1850dc2040714.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dr John Cavaness: The story of the deadly doctor of Eldorado</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Eddie Ray Routh?</h2><p class=align-left>On February 2, 2013, the world awoke to the sad news that there was a shooting incident near Chalk Mountain in Texas. Surprisingly, Eddie was the perpetrator of the shooting incident that ended the life of Chris Kyle. Kyle had retired from the military, and he was helping the veterans to deal with <a href=#>mental issues</a>.</p><p class=align-left>On the day of the unfortunate incident, Eddie's mother had asked Kyle for help in dealing with her troubled son. Kyle and Littlefield asked Eddie to accompany them to a remote shooting range at the Rough Creek Lodge and Resort, southwest of Dallas. They were armed with an arsenal of pistols, rifles, and ammunition. Upon arrival at the range, he turned on them and shot them.</p><p class=align-left>Kyle and Littlefield never had a chance to defend themselves. Littlefield was struck seven times in the back, shoulder, head, and hand. On the other hand, Kyle was hit six times in the head, shoulder, chest, and right arm. After killing Kyle and Littlefield, Routh drove Kyle's pickup truck back to his home in Lancaster, Texas.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1afb04aa2916c153.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Camm family murders story: Where is David Camm now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So, why did Eddie Ray Routh kill an American sniper? At that time, Routh was under extreme mental stress and was convinced that Kyle and Littlefield were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">planning to kill him </a>as they were not talking to him when he was riding in the back seat of the truck on the way to the shooting range. So, he felt bad about it, and this is the reason why he shot them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a27077be078e927e.jpg><p class=align-left>When the case was brought before the courts, he admitted to shooting Chris Kyle and his friend 13 times. Eddie's defence attorneys entered a plea of not guilty by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reason of insanity</a>. However, the psychologists testified that he was not legally insane but had a paranoid disorder made worse by his drink and cannabis abuse.</p><h3>Where is Eddie Ray Routh now?</h3><p class=align-left>After deliberating on the case, the jury found him guilty of the murders of Chris Kyle and Littlefield and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Is Eddie Ray Routh still alive? He is still alive and is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">serving his sentence </a>at the Louis C Powledge Unit in Anderson County, Texas.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/edd6d8616df82ec1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Adam Lambert's partner?

She is currently working as a contributor for <a href=#>Fox News </a>and lives in Texas. After her husband was killed in 2013, Kyle began giving speeches regarding his U.S. Navy military service and issues faced by veterans across the country.</p><p class=align-left>She became an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">advocate for widowed women </a>and families who have lost serving family members. Taya published her autobiography titled <i>American Wife: A Memoir of Love, Service, Faith, and Renewal, </i>in which she explains how she dealt with her husband Chris' untimely death. She and Chris were blessed with two kids, Colton Kyle and McKenna Kyle.</p><h2>Who played Eddie Ray Routh in American Sniper?</h2><p class=align-left>The film adaptation of Eddie's story was already in theatres in Stephenville when his murder trial began there on February 11, 2014. In the film, Vincent Selhorst-Jones was cast to play the role of Eddie Ray Routh while Bradley Cooper takes on the role of Chris Kyle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife?

Unlike in the real-life story, the filmmakers left out Chris Kyle's violent murder at the end of the blockbuster movie for the sake of his two kids. When he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">penned the final script </a>of the movie, Jason Hall thought about how the death scene would affect Chris's children. The film ends at the scene where Chris is heading to the Rough Creek Lodge with Routh.</p><p class=align-left>Now you know what happened to Eddie Ray Routh. Eddie was diagnosed with PTSD shortly after being discharged from Marine Corps. He suffered a host of mental problems and resorted to marijuana and alcohol. Sadly, he ended the lives of Chris and Littlefield, who had been called upon by his mother to help him out with his mental issues.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>published an article about <a href=#>what happened to Tobuscus</a>.
