There are so many options available that all seem so similar that it can be difficult to know where to start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, we’ve narrowed down the options for you to some of the very best cookie managers that the Chrome Web Store has to offer.</p><p>So, if you’re looking for cookie editor extensions for Google Chrome, here are some you definitely need to check out.</p><h2 id=editthiscookie>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EditThisCookie</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EditThisCookie-In-Use.jpg><p>EditThisCookie is an extension for Google Chrome that fully integrates a cookie manager right into your browser.</p><p>EditThisCookie claims to be the very first cookie manager for Google Chrome, and though this claim may be difficult to substantiate, there’s no denying that it is definitely one of the best. With EditThisCookie, you can easily edit, add, delete, and block cookies—amongst a whole range of other options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What’s great about EditThisCookie is the diverse range of options that you have access to when you use this extension. You can adjust EditThisCookie to work exactly how you want it to by adjusting these values. For example, you may want the page to automatically reload after you make changes or add extra context menus or development tools.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that EditThisCookie may be a little imposing for those of you who aren’t particularly familiar with cookie editors. There is supposedly a help menu to guide you on your way, though it doesn’t seem to always load correctly. This may make it a little difficult to get started.</p><h2 id=vanilla-cookie-manager>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanilla Cookie Manager</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Vanilla-Cookie-Manager-In-Use.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next up, we have Vanilla Cookie Manager. This Chrome extension is a great option if you’re looking to clean up your Chrome browser and protect your privacy.</p><p>Using Vanilla Cookie Manager is a super simple thing to get into. There are only four options available when you access the extension button in the top-right of your browser.</p><p>Two of them are there to help you whitelist pages that you trust or want to keep your details saved on. Websites with login information, such as Netflix or Twitter, are probably good candidates to put on this whitelist—so that you don’t have to log in every time you visit them.</p><p>That being said, it never hurts to look into <a href=#>what exactly a website cookie is and how it affects your online privacy</a>. That way, you’ll be able to make a more informed decision about what you do and don’t want to add to your whitelist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From there, you can click the remaining button to clear unwanted cookies. As easy as that, you’ve made a step towards protecting your privacy.</p><p>If you don’t like the idea of having to consistently press a button to clear out your cookies, you can also set Vanilla Cookie Manager to do it for you automatically. There are a couple of different ways that you can do this.</p><p>You can set it up so that Vanilla Cookie Manager will automatically clear unwanted cookies when you start up your browser. You can also set it to do so periodically, such as every 15 minutes.</p><h2 id=swap-my-cookies>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swap My Cookies</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Swap-My-Cookies-In-Use.jpg><p>If you’re looking for a cookie editor for Google Chrome because you want to swap between accounts or profiles easily, then Swap My Cookies might just be the best option for you on this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At its core, Swap My Cookies is a pretty straightforward concept with some great execution. Swap My Cookies behaves as a session manager for your cookies, allowing you to log in to any website from many accounts with ease.</p><p>If you share your computer with multiple people or just have a lot of different accounts for the same service, then Swap My Cookies is a great little tool to help you do just that. If you were excited to learn that <a href=#>Microsoft made it easier to swap between Teams accounts</a>, this should be a pretty big deal to you.</p><p>All you have to do to use Swap My Cookies is set up a couple of different profiles with different login information. With just a couple of clicks, you can then select these profiles, which will have completely different login information.</p><p>You can rename these profiles to make it easier to remember which is which, as well as reset, sort, and copy them as you see fit. You can also set up keyboard shortcuts for each profile to make it easier to swap between them if you so choose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What’s really cool about Swap My Cookies, however, is that it supports integration with EditThisCookie as well. This means that if you need to edit your cookies in-depth as well as swap them, then you can.</p><h2 id=cookie-editor>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cookie Editor</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CookieEditorIn-Use.jpg><p>Next up on this list comes Cookie Editor. If you’re looking for a cookie editor that’s robust and feature-rich while being a little easier to use than some alternatives on this list, then Cookie Editor might just be the option for you.</p><p>Cookie Editor does everything you’d expect from a cookie manager or editor, such as adding new cookies, deleting cookies, and editing them. You can also back up and restore your cookies, as well as import and export them to and from files.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest draw with Cookie Editor is the way that it’s structured, however. The UI is easy to understand and quick to get used to. There are a lot of extra options available as well, such as news about releases and more.</p><h2 id=cookie-editor>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cookie-Editor</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cookie-Editor-In-Use.jpg><p>If you’re just looking for a simple cookie editor that will allow you to quickly and easily edit your cookies without any extra bells or whistles, then Cookie-Editor is a good option to do just that.</p><p>With Cookie-Editor, you can easily create, edit, and delete cookies from the current page that you’re visiting. You can also easily mass-delete all cookies from the same page.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are options to import or export your cookies to text, and a search bar that will let you find what you’re looking for in a pinch.</p><p>All these features make Cookie-Editor great if you’re just looking for a no-nonsense cookie editing extension.</p><h2 id=edit-your-cookies-with-ease>Edit Your Cookies With Ease</h2><p>As you can see, there are a bunch of different options available for you if you want to try and edit your cookies, no matter your reasons.</p><p>What’s great about these Google Chrome extensions is how easy they are to add or remove, which means that there’s no reason not to give them a shot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGieqKeXobJur8erpqadXZi8sLfInmSenJmpvLN5xLGrnqajnryvv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-seven-most-terrifying-christmas-traditions-around-the-world.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The seven most terrifying Christmas traditions around the world</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hipster-hats-the-art-of-helixing-harry-styles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hipster hats: the art of 'helixing' | Fashion</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
