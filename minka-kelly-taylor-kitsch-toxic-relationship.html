"I say it became toxic as a result of one: being under the pressure cooker of a new show. You're 26 years old and in your twenties, I think there's a chance that might happen if you come from where I come from and you have the tools that I have or don't have."</p><p>She added, "What was important to me and what I really tried to do, especially in that chapter, was keep the focus on my s---. On me."</p><p>"It wasn't important what I felt anyone did to me or was unfair to me. It's not about that and my whole journey is about how have I contributed to the things that aren't working out in my life," she continued, before admitting that "the word 'toxic' makes me cringe a little bit."</p><p>Expressing some regret over her word choice, she added, "I hate that. I wish I would've said 'unhealthy' or something else." She concluded, "But it did feel like the right way to describe the way that went at that time as a result of how I handled things."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2c752b7b-de87-4f31-838f-3e57fc5a7759 data-container-ref=toofab:article:97eaebb3-7ea0-4ac4-b8ae-b817ee5999d2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c2/5by4/2023/04/13/c2e01d0a494545f5ab38f0fe17cfc5fc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Minka Kelly Talks Working Peep Shows at 17, Going to Strip Clubs with 'Exotic Dancer' Mother</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In the book, Kelly said the two -- who met on the set of the football series back in 2006 -- "fell in lust fast and hard" and were "infatuated with each other."</p><p>"It’s just that the good only lasted so long before our incompatibility reared its ugly head. We ended up getting back together and breaking up more times than I can count," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared</a>. "When it was good, it was good.
