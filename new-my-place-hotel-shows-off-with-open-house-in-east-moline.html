They also have properties in North Aurora, Ill., two in the Des Moines area and one in Council Bluffs.</p><p>“My Place is known as an extended-stay hotel,” Rivett said. “What you’ll find in a My Place is typically better than 50% of people stay one to four nights, and the other 50% stay longer. It’s the contractors, the transportation people, trainers, and professionals of all different natures that enjoy the amenities inside the room, the simplicity of the hotel itself, and the fact that the hotel size and form allows them to get to know the staff, the family atmosphere and the friendly environment they walk into.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/11/MyP5.jpg><p>The East Moline hotel has just seven employees, but plans to grow.</p><p>All of their rooms provide a My Kitchen, which includes a full-sized refrigerator with ice maker, a two-burner cooktop, coffee maker, desk, and a microwave. Also available for their guests, are onsite laundry facilities. They encourage their guests to bring their four-legged friends, as they are pet friendly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/11/bedroom.jpg><p>In East Moline, the hotel is connected to the Bend XPO Center and within walking distance to the Bend Event Center, Rust Belt, and the Mississippi River. They will work with all local companies to provide discounted rates with ease of booking access by booking through a private direct booking link.</p><p>Tennant attended the Davenport My&nbsp;Place ribbon-cutting and recalled it was a really great franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/11/MyP6.jpg><p>“I got to know the team at My Place and fast forward a few years, and we finally got one in East Moline,” he said Thursday. “It’s been a long journey.”</p><p>“We’re excited to be here; we’re excited to continue developing down here at The Bend,” Tennant said. They wanted to have a complement for the Bend XPO, which opened in April 2020, at the height of COVID.</p><p>“People were asking for a hotel that was connected to the property,” he said. “The other properties in the community — The Waterfront (in Bettendorf) is connected to The Isle; the RiverCenter is connected to the Doubletree (former Radisson). So we did it. We wanted to do something down&nbsp;here for a long time.”</p><p>The <a href=#>nine-story Hyatt hotel</a> at The Bend has 99 rooms (as well as the River Room bar on the top floor) and opened in December 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/11/MyP3.jpg><p>“We’re in close proximity to John Deere Harvester, when they have contractors in,” Tennant said. “With the grants that East Moline has received, there will be more development downtown. That’s gonna bring construction workers. It’s gonna make things happen. That is where we’re at and we think the weekday stay, and this market has need for rooms for the weekends, with all the events at the Bettplex, sporting events.”</p><p>It’s also perfect&nbsp;for wedding parties, he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Bend XPO general manager DeAnna Freeman-Foster (her father is East Moline Mayor Reggie Freeman) said the center hosts over 100 events a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/11/MyP2.jpg><p>“We work very closely with Visit Quad Cities, so when they’re bidding on opportunities that haven’t been in the areas, this will help them&nbsp;be competitive because some of these larger&nbsp;corporations or organizations want a conference space with a hotel that’s connected, so their employees don’t have to drive,” she said. “Everything’s right there.”</p><p>“It helps be a little more competitive,” Freeman-Foster said. My Place gives visitors and meetings another option, compared&nbsp;to the neighboring Hyatt, she said.</p><p>“They are two totally different properties. Who might stay there and somebody who stays here may be totally different and vice versa,” Freeman-Foster (who’s worked 17 years in the hotel industry) said.</p><p>For more information on My Place, <a href=#>click HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKWer12ixm68y5qanmWYpMGmuIysn6ivo2K8p7KMsKCtoF2kvaa6jKGmrquVYravecSaqq1lnaS5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./snapchat-enters-augmented-reality-partnership-with-live-nation-for-live-concerts-and-festivals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snapchat Enters Augmented Reality Partnership with Live Nation For Concerts and Festivals</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-jesper-parnevik-make-latest-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Jesper Parnevik Make?
