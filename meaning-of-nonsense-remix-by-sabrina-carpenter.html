The lyrics paint a picture of a complicated romance, full of contradictions and mixed emotions. While it may seem like a simple love song on the surface, a closer look reveals a deeper exploration of themes such as passion, manipulation, and the paradoxical nature of love.One standout lyric in the song is "I think I only like one person on my phone, I will be hatin' when we toxic, he can't leave me alone." This lyric portrays the complex feelings of the singer. On one hand, she acknowledges that she only likes this person in her phone, implying that their connection primarily exists in a digital realm. However, she also admits to hating the toxic nature of their relationship, indicating that she is aware of the negative dynamics at play. This lyric explores the theme of ambivalence, as the singer finds herself torn between her desire for connection and the toxicity that accompanies it.Another notable lyric is "Just be lying to me on the phone, I just love it when he's desperate, he don't know where I go". Here, the singer reveals that she enjoys being deceived by her partner. This lyric delves into the theme of manipulation, as the singer seems to take pleasure in the power dynamics of their relationship. It suggests a certain level of self-destructive behavior, where the singer is drawn to the dishonesty and emotional turmoil that comes with her partner's desperation. This theme highlights the complexities and contradictions within relationships and human desires.In the second verse, the lyric "He can't help himself when he's just by me, his tongue goes through my mouth when he kissed me" adds another layer to the song's themes. This lyric explores the theme of passion and intensity in relationships. It showcases the physical connection between the singer and her partner, emphasizing the magnetic pull they have towards one another. However, the aggression implied by "his tongue goes through my mouth" also hints at a certain level of dominance and submission. This theme emphasizes the heightened emotions and sensuality that can exist in toxic relationships, blurring the lines between pleasure and pain.Overall, 'Nonsense Remix' by Sabrina Carpenter delves into the complex aspects of a toxic relationship.
