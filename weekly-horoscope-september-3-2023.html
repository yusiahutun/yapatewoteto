However, that doesn’t mean there won’t be confusion along the way.</p><p>The week jumps off with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus retrograde finally coming to an end</a>, stationing direct at 12 degrees Leo. In case you haven’t noticed, this summer was filled with endless celebrity breakups and drama when it comes to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">money, stability, and unity</a>. Now that Venus is no longer in backward motion, you can expect hearts to begin mending, as the trials you experienced have paved the way for an even deeper form of self-love.</p><p>However, let’s remember that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercury is still retrograde</a>, which means there may be miscommunications and disorganized planning that brings up some of those old wounds until it stations direct on September 15. Luckily, just before Jupiter—planet of optimism, expansion, and spiritual growth—stations retrograde on September 4, you may be left with a positive revelation that gives you enough hope to last you these next few weeks. After all, Mercury will form a trine with Jupiter, helping us tap into brilliant ideas that give us the confidence to take a chance on something with a lot of potential.</p><p>However, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">third quarter moon in Gemini</a> arrives on September 6, putting us right in the emotional center of what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this Mercury retrograde</a> means for you. After all, Gemini is ruled by Mercury, which means this retrograde is taking the center-stage in our hearts. Emotions may run high as your logic aims to make sense of what you’re feeling. Remember—it’s OK to feel whatever you feel, even if it makes no bloody sense at all.</p><p>By the time the sun forms a trine with Jupiter retrograde on September 8, you may embrace a form of inner growth that leads to self-acceptance and self-reliance. After all, Jupiter is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>retrograding through Taurus</a>, a money-oriented and romantic zodiac sign that craves stability and access to resources. What can you do to take care of yourself better and provide yourself with the material pleasures that ground you? Having too much of something can be just as painful as not having enough.</p><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week><strong>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This W</strong>eek</h2><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.6532333645736><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>This week, you’re formulating plans.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, September 3, with an extraordinary day.
