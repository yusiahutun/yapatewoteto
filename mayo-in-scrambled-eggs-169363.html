Well, so did I — until I tried this cooking trick out for myself.</p><p>Celebrity chef Alton Brown has made headlines over the years for many of his unique cooking hacks. But one specific tip from his book EveryDayCook (<a rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>$18.99, Amazon</a>) has been raising quite a few eyebrows lately: Add a dollop of mayo (We love <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Hellmann’s</a> / <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Best Foods</a>&nbsp;Light Mayonnaise) when you’re cooking scrambled eggs. Supposedly, the mayo will take your ordinary breakfast to the next level of luxury and creaminess. <a rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Brown promises</a>, “You’ll never know the mayo is in there until you leave it out.”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>As a mayo skeptic, I was doubtful that the spread could really make that much of a difference for my breakfast. After all, I usually <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">season my eggs</a> very generously, going beyond the typical salt and pepper with spices such as basil, oregano, and turmeric. Plus, I typically add cheese or veggies to the mix. However, I couldn’t help but be intrigued by the novelty of <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">trying something new with eggs</a> — even though I was convinced they couldn’t possibly need anything else. So I decided to go to the grocery store one night and do something I haven’t done since college: I bought a jar of mayo.</p><p>The next morning, I waited for my coffee to brew as I cracked three eggs into my favorite pan. One by one, they glided over the olive-oil spray I had coated the pan with moments before. Then, I opened the mayo jar and gently slid a kitchen spoon inside to scoop up a “dollop” — which was (hopefully) no more than a tablespoon in size. As I hovered the spoon above my eggs, I paused for a moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/mayo-scrambled-eggs.jpg><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: FirstForWomen.com)</p><p>Did I really want to take the risk of possibly ruining my breakfast before 8 a.m.? But then, I reasoned with myself: I had already opened the mayo, and I didn’t want to waste the rest of the jar — or the money I spent on it. And in my pre-coffee haze, I remembered all the fancy chefs I’ve heard about who used heavy cream or crème fraîche in scrambled egg recipes. Surely, mayo couldn’t be that different, right?</p><p>I took a deep breath and plopped the mayo right into the pan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/scrambled-eggs-with-mayo.jpg><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: FirstForWomen.com)</p><p>Perhaps out of habit, I started stirring the eggs first over low heat, leaving the mayo quite literally in the middle of it all. Fortunately, I quickly came to my senses and immediately interspersed the mayo throughout the whole mixture long before the eggs started scrambling.</p><p>The actual cooking process happened pretty fast: In a matter of minutes, my scrambled eggs came together. They looked done without being too done, creamy without being too runny, and most importantly, absolutely delicious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: FirstForWomen.com)</p><p>Prior to this experiment, I originally thought about adding a couple of my usual accompaniments to the mix, such as cheese or greens. But after I turned off the heat, I realized that I wanted to experience the mayo in scrambled eggs by itself. (OK, maybe I could add salt and pepper, but that was it!)</p><p>Folks, I am so glad I did this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: FirstForWomen.com)</p><p>As it turns out, scrambled eggs with mayo is so good that I didn’t feel the need to add any extra ingredients, or even any more spices. Though I kept my salt and pepper shakers handy nearby just in case, I didn’t even have time to consider adding more than I had already put on top. Before I knew it, my plate was clean.</p><p>Lush and decadent, scrambled eggs mixed with mayo is something you have to try for yourself at least once. Chances are, it’ll remind you of an egg dish you might purchase at a nice restaurant for brunch on the weekend. The best part? You don’t have to leave your home or change out of your PJs to enjoy them.</p><p>This post was sponsored by Hellmann’s/Best Foods.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJoqqmnnqi8s7HDaKSasZ9itq950pypmqWSobKlecSgnqxlYWuGdIKS</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-affleck-bill-maher-sam-harris-islam-racist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Affleck: Sam Harris and Bill Maher 'racist' and 'gross' in views of Islam | Ben Affleck</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./v-stiviano-video-house-public-mask.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>V.
