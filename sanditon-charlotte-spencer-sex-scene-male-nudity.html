"They [producers] spoke to them about it. Anything they weren't comfortable with, they didn't do. It was a really fun time. It's also historically accurate - it's not there for no reason."<br></p><img alt="Mika Simmons & Bryony Gordon Host Dinner In The 'Feel Good Garden' At 100 Wardour St" title="Mika Simmons & Bryony Gordon Host Dinner In The 'Feel Good Garden' At 100 Wardour St" width=2724 height=4067 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/charlotte-spencer-attends-a-dinner-hosted-by-mika-simmons-news-photo-1158938253-1564742092.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David M.

She also ruminated that when women go naked, they're usually sexualised in ways that men aren't. When men go nude, there's often a comical element to it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's like, guys, you have no idea how it's been for such a long time for females!" she continued. "There's nearly always a job that will require nudity and you have to discuss this so much, and the difference is that it's a deeper thing when a woman does it as opposed to a man. A man can do it in a funny way, but usually with a woman nudity is always sexual. With this, it was for comical reasons. I find it so funny that people are outraged by the human body when we all have one."</p><img alt="Theo James" title=Sanditon width=5887 height=3924 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sanditon-02-0-1564743472.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">ITV</span><p>Theo James as Sidney Parker</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the furtive sex act scene between Fox's Edward Denham and Lily Sacofsky's Clara Brereton, the 27-year-old Line of Duty star explained that it's integral to their storyline and will have repercussions, while exploring the misogynistic conventions of that time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Again, it's alluded to in the book but back then she [Austen] would never have been able to say that, it was a totally different time and a totally different era," Spencer said. "And yet we all know from stories of that era, and with the kings and queens who came from times before that, was all debauchery - especially in the higher classes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Of course they had sex! It's shocking to me that people are shocked. It was very important that Lily [who plays Clara] knew exactly what she was briefed on. I don't think she would have taken it on it if it didn't serve the story. It's not there for any no reason; it's there to push the story forward, and you'll understand when you see more of the episodes what it means. It's a really interesting storyline between me, Lily and Jack."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Spencer added that the more 'modern' aspects of the drama which reflect real life "humanises" the series and adds inclusivity.</p><img alt=Sanditon title="Sanditon " width=3759 height=2506 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sanditon-13-1564742655.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Simon Ridgway</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">ITV</span><p>Crystal Clarke as Miss Lambe in Sanditon</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There has been a positive shift in TV period dramas which are becoming more representative in terms of gender, sexuality and race.

"Crystal [Clarke - who plays Miss Georgiana Lambe] says Jane Austen included characters of colour, including her character heiress Miss Lambe, who was biracial [and Austen normalises Miss Lambe's position within English society].</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"This story should be told not always as slaves or the underclass, that's not the story you need to be telling, it's the story of people in these roles in this world. The stories are real. Jane Austen wrote this. And I think it's important we don't shy away from that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Spencer added: "It's not about modernising it it's just about revealing more of the story than we've ever been told before. And for some reason, because we've only ever been told it in a certain light, all the sex was alluded to. Now we're telling it how it really is. We're humanising it more."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">ITV's Sanditon airs in autumn.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">TV shows 2019: All the exciting female-led dramas to watch this year</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="Charly Clive" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/marniein-her-bedroom04-1548689345.jpg title="Channel 4's Pure " width=3000 height=2143 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSyr8DEq6uaoZ6isq%2FAjpppcW1oaoV0fI6smKecmam8r3nCoZirpJ%2BpwaZ50qmcp5uVp3q0sddmqpydnpp6rq3LnmSnrZSewbp7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./second-student-16-19-000-year-jesuit-prep-school-jumps-train-two-weeks-leaving-thousands-stranded-grand-central-rush-hour-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Second Fordham Prep school student jumps in front of a train in New York</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./copa-confederaciones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Con la calculadora para hacer historia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
