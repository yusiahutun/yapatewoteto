The mother of triplets was reported missing on June 1st, 2011, and the <a href=#>family</a> got concerned about their whereabouts.</p><p class=align-left>But who is Clay Waller? Jame Clay Walker was Jacque's husband. He pleaded guilty to murdering his wife and was charged and sentenced.</p><h2>Jacque and Clay Waller's relationship</h2><p class=align-left>Jacque and Clay had three children, two girls and a boy. She was a determined and hardworking mother. She did her motherly duty of raising triplets and managed her 40 hours a week job. However, her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">husband was the opposite</a>. Even though he claimed to love his family, he did not do much to help them.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, he moved from one job to the next and began having multiple affairs. He was even abusive to his wife. As a result, his in-laws did not like him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8601c7c1939bc9ee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Timothy Madden: Gabbi Doolin murder sentence and latest updates</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg><p class=align-left>Jacque decided that she had had enough of Clay and decided to end the <a href=#>marriage</a>. However, when she informed him, he became more violent and began threatening her. She became afraid and began keeping records of the threats. He once told her he would kill her if she divorced him.</p><h2>What happened to Jacque Waller?</h2><p class=align-left>In the morning of that day, Jacque had met her estranged husband, Clay Waller, at the attorney's office. The pair had separated months before and were finalising the paperwork for their divorce proceedings. After the meeting, Jacque accompanied Clay to his home in Jackson, Missouri. It was the last time she would be seen alive.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately, before she went to Clay's house, she informed her sister Cheryl Brenneke. So, at around 7 P.M., when she had not returned, Cheryl got concerned. She tried reaching her via phone, but the <a href=#>phone</a> was off. She reached out to Clay, who told her she had not seen Jacque.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Felicia Forbes: The story of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The next day, Jacque's car, a Honda Pilot, was found abandoned along Interstate 55. Unfortunately, her body could not be located. It was also difficult for the <a href=#>police officers</a> to establish what had happened to Jacque and where she was.</p><p class=align-left>Clay's actions caused his downfall in the end. He went around the town taunting the police and Jacque's family. He told them they would not find her body. As a result, the police believed her ex-husband was responsible for her disappearance.</p><h2>Arrest and trial of Clay Waller</h2><p class=align-left>Clay Waller was arrested in September 2011. Interestingly, not on a matter related to his wife's disappearance. He was charged with making an online threat that he would kill Cheryl Brenneke, Jacque's sister. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison in Louisiana.</p><p class=align-left>In April 2012, Waller was charged with first-degree murder in Jacque's disappearance and presumed death. Initially, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pleaded not guilty</a> but reconsidered afterwards. With the assistance of his defence lawyer, they worked out a plea deal with the prosecutor.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The plea deal included agreeing to killing her and showing the authorities where he had buried the body. Then, the charge would be reduced to second-degree murder. Considering that Jacque's family wanted to know where their daughter was, the prosecutor agreed.</p><h2>Where was Jackie Waller found?</h2><p class=align-left>The police later learned that Waller had prepared for his wife's death a day before. He told them he dug a grave for his wife on May 31st, 2011, on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River at Devil’s Island. The island was only accessible by boat.</p><p class=align-left>He also revealed that he beat and strangled Jacque at his house and took the body across the river to bury it. He led the police to Jacque's body on May 29th, 2013, nearly two years after the heinous act.</p><h2>What happened to Clay Waller?</h2><p class=align-left>Clay was sentenced to 20 years in prison on June 6th, 2013. 20 years was the maximum penalty allowable for a reduced charge. The law also required him to serve at least 85% of the sentence before being eligible for parole.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5482574292cc6508.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Harvey: The untold story of Steve Harvey's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before his sentencing, Clay listened to Jacque's loved ones read their victim impact statement. Jacque Waller's son, Maddox, labelled his father a 'fat j*erk' and regretted that he was his father. He made sure his Clay Walker knew exactly how the children felt. Clay Walker's children, Avery, Maddox, and Addison, were adopted by Cheryl Brenneke.</p><h2>Where is Clay Walker now?</h2><p class=align-left>Clay is currently serving his 55 years in prison. While in prison, he collaborated with another inmate, Cedric Dean, to write a book titled <i>If You Take My Kids, I’ll Kill You: The Public Confession of Missouri’s Most Notorious Wife Killed</i>. However, when the book was complete, Dean smuggled it out, resulting in their fallout.</p><p class=align-left>In May 2016, investigators became aware of Dean’s manuscript. They tracked him down to a prison in Ohio. Interestingly, this manuscript would later divulge what the public did not know about Jacque's death.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/04fb4b03cd772d72.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Deborah Kiley cause of death and life story: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Cedric Deam agreed to testify against Clay. In October 2017, Waller pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interstate domestic violence. He was slapped <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">with an additional 35 years</a> in prison that December.</p><h2>Jacque Waller's documentary</h2><p class=align-left>The story of Jacque Waller's death is captured in a <a href=#>documentary</a> titled <i>Devil’s Island: Missouri’s Jacque Waller case</i>.</p><h2>Quick facts about Jacque Waller</h2><li>How many children did Jacque Waller have?
