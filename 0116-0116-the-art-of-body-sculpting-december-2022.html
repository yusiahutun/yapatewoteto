I’d heard that her treatments, which are sought after by models, Hollywood insiders, and well-heeled Parisians, were transformative. What I learned, however, is they’re not relaxing. As de Richeville kneaded my stomach, legs, arms, and back, encouraging fluid movement and, in her words, “reorganizing fat cells to contour the body,” I winced and stifled a yelp more than once.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Done!” she announced after an hour, pointing at my now-flat belly and leaner legs. As I sat up, I noted that I also felt lighter and more energetic.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While that was my first experience with body sculpting, this type of treatment has been popular in western Europe for nearly a century. It was originally developed in the early 1930s by Emil Vodder, a Danish massage therapist who theorized, after noting swollen lymph nodes in sick patients, that massage might mobilize fluid in the lymph system, helping the body eliminate toxins faster—and patients heal sooner. This proved true, and in 1936, Vodder introduced “manual lymph drainage” to the medical community in Paris. Eventually the technique made its way to spas, where it’s been adapted and used to reduce puffiness from stagnant fluid and remodel the body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These treatments have not been widely available historically in the U.S., but that’s changing. “Social media has raised awareness of wellness, including a focus on our lymphatic system,” says<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/flavialanini/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Flávia Lanini" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> Flávia Lanini</a>, a Los Angeles lymphatic-massage therapist who boasts clients like Hailey Bieber and Dua Lipa—and a months-long wait list for her services.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“Massage enhances the fluid flow in the lymphatic system; it’s the solution to body pollution.”<br>Maurice Beer<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some new-to-the-U.S. slimming treatments are marketed as being akin to routine manicures, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thetoxtechnique.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Tox" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the Tox</a> and<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stretchdspace.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Stretch*d" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> Stretch*d</a>, both in New York, inviting clients to pop in for a treatment during a lunch break. Others, such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.ricaristudios.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ricari Studios" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ricari Studios</a>, which launched a residency at the Mercer hotel in New York in 2022 and will open another in Hotel Emma in San Antonio in early 2023, provide a more luxurious experience. Then there are those that take a medi-spa approach, offering depuffing treatments developed under the guidance of a doctor, like physician Maurice Beer, who is medical director of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cleanmarket.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clean Market" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Clean Market</a> in Manhattan. “Lymph nodes are connected by vessels that carry fluid and nutrients back into the bloodstream, release antibodies to fight infection, and help remove toxins from the digestive tract. Massage enhances the fluid flow in the lymphatic system; it’s the solution to body pollution,” explains Beer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Location and vibe are not the only components that may differ between remodeling services. “The term ‘lymphatic massage’ refers to a variety of modalities,” says Anna Zahn, a lymphatic-massage specialist and founder of the aforementioned Ricari Studios. The original Vodder technique, she says, “uses featherlight gliding, compressing, stretching, and cupping motions,” while many French aestheticians (including de Richeville) often “employ a strong, sometimes painful, palpating and rolling technique.” Finally, there’s a Brazilian approach (favored by Lanini) in which manual manipulation of the body may be supplemented with wooden tools.<br></p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop At-Home Lymphatic Drainage Products<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are also ways to achieve benefits at home—and that’s how I’ve sought to maintain the results I got at de Richeville’s studio. Dry brushes (my personal favorite), massage rollers, and even your hands can all be used to support detoxification, says Viviane Lieberman, a massage therapist and educator for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://gentebeauty.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gente Beauty" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gente Beauty</a>, which makes products for DIY massage. She suggests starting at your legs, then working up to your stomach, flanks, arms, and chest—always massaging or brushing toward your lymph nodes (behind the knees, above the thighs, under the chest, in the armpit, and along the collarbone) to encourage fluid movement. In addition to massage or dry brushing, Zahn adds that drinking lots of water, Epsom-salt baths, routine saunas, or even wriggling into compressionwear to boost blood flow will all also minimize fluid buildup and prevent bloating and puffiness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGdkaHBqXvAbWhya2FpfnF7j2pob2VgZn53edOhnGaZoql6sLKMm6adsV2osLa4z62gp59dmbKkscybnKtlYmV%2Fc3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./play-peacemaker-word-craze.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Play peacemaker Word Craze Answer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./micah-richards-host-family-porn-31618483.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Micah Richards' host family found star's hidden porn DVD and asked him about it at dinner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
