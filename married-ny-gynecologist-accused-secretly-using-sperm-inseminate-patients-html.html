sperm, despite telling them that he was using a donor.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wortman, who is married and works at The Center of Menstrual Disorders in Rochester, was paid $50&nbsp;two-to-three times a month by Hellquist's mother for each insemination attempt between late 1983 and January 1985, the lawsuit says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hellquist, of Geneseo, NY,

Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry that were born in 1984 and 1985.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also discovered two other half siblings born in the same year as her and another half-brother that was
