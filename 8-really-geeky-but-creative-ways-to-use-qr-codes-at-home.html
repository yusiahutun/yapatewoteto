If you're looking to have a bit of fun with QR codes, here are eight things to try.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-qr-codes>What Are QR Codes?</h2><p>The QR code had quite the hi-tech beginning–Toyota used them in their manufacturing process for scanning automobile components. From there, QR codes have made the journey to even fashion ramps. This transition demonstrates the technology's popularity, but not quite their usefulness.</p><p>QR codes transport URLs very well. You can make them yourself easily, and you can read them just as easily with the functionality built-in to the camera app on many smartphones.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Scan a QR Code on Android and iPhone</a></span></p><p>You may say that <a href=#>QR codes are fads</a>, some may say <a href=#>QR codes are awesome</a>. At the end of the day, QR Codes are a tool, and with a bit of thought, QR codes can be used in fun and useful ways around the house too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-audio-fridge-door-note>1. The Audio Fridge Door Note</h2><p>Can’t get through to your kids? It’s time to ditch the fridge note and pick up a handy QR generator instead. Kids are more easily susceptible to technology and the novelty of QR codes with custom messages placed covertly in least-expected areas (like a messy cupboard, a lunch box, or on the video game console) could get their attention.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 6 Best Dictation Apps for iPhone</a></span></p><p>By creating a shareable link to a voice recording, you can share this audio with a QR code. The QR code can be left on the fridge door or any other place. Of course, there are better ways to communicate, but this is a much more fun way to do so.</p><h2 id=sharing-wi-fi>2. Sharing Wi-Fi</h2><p>This is a hack that is often spoken about, but it remains relevant if you want to quickly share your Wi-Fi with guests and friends. We have briefly covered a tool like QR Code Wi-Fi before that helps you quickly generate a code with your Wi-Fi parameters. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">QRStuff</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">QR Code Generator</a> are other tools you can check out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WiFi-QR-Code-In-Cafe-e1626710306224.jpg><p>You can download and print a QR code that automatically signs guests into your Wi-Fi network. Keep it next to your router or hang it up for your guests. While you might typically see these in restaurants or cafés, it'll save you the bother of repeatedly giving the Wi-Fi details.</p><h2 id=lost-and-found>3. Lost and Found</h2><p>You can generate your own QR code with contact details like your address and phone number. You can then print these out, and use them to tag your pet collars.</p><p>Rather than spending money on an expensive engraving for a pet's name tag, why not use a QR code sticker instead? Since almost everybody can scan a QR code with the phone in their pocket, it's the perfect modern-day solution.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Apple AirTags Explained: How They Work, Their Price, and More</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why stop there? Throw a QR code onto every product you own in case you lose it. Sure, it might not help you as much as an AirTag might, but it increases your chances of finding your belongings.</p><h2 id=moving-amp-packing>4. Moving & Packing</h2><p>QR code labeled stickers with the inventory of what’s inside a particular box is a great time-saving device. This is a real-world use that is surprisingly effective, since QR codes can store text information, among other things.</p><p>A quick scan with a QR code reader saves you dollops of time when you have moved house and are rummaging around for that hammer among the litter of boxes. Of course, you could just write on the box, but where's the fun in that?</p><h2 id=tag-your-electronics-with-the-manual>5. Tag Your Electronics With the Manual</h2><p>One idea to go completely paperless is to connect your device manuals to the devices themselves using QR codes.</p><p>You can keep the manual PDFs stored in the cloud and convert the URL to a QR code. Paste the code sticker on your device. The next time when you need to consult the manual, you can do so straight from your smartphone by scanning the code on the device.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also encode data like a device’s purchase date, serial number, and customer service center number, to keep it handy for ready reference. You can also include your name and address as a basic anti-theft precaution.</p><h2 id=tag-your-books>6. Tag Your Books</h2><p>Whether it's tagging your books with your name, or with information about why you bought the book, people love tagging books</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Book-QR-Code-e1626710546864.jpg><p>A QR code is the perfect way to tag your book. Regardless of what you want to tag your book with, a QR code lets you do so less intrusively. Handwritten notes can look messy and sometimes bleed through the pages–a QR code avoids that completely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=digital-greeting-cards>7. Digital Greeting Cards</h2><p>QR codes can also offer a way to get creative with your greeting cards. Fewer and fewer people send physical greeting cards anymore. But imagine what you could do with a combo that uses a physical greeting card and a QR code stuck on it that links to an online home video shouting out the real greeting.</p><p>It's easy to turn a cheap greeting card into a dynamic multimedia card with a more personal touch. You'll need to store your home video on YouTube or another cloud storage platform. Simply take the link and convert it into a QR code, and print it on a greeting card.</p><h2 id=dispatch-directions>8. Dispatch Directions</h2><p>It's inevitable that people are going to get lost when you're supposed to meet them. Whether they took the wrong exit on the freeway, or are trying to get somewhere completely hidden, directions are tricky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scan-Directions-QR-Code-e1626710444949.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, rather than describing directions to someone, why not hand them a QR code? If you know you need to frequently direct visitors to your house, you could offer them a QR code with the directions saved. This is also a handy tool for a wedding or party invitations.</p><h2 id=qr-codes-are-more-useful-than-they-seem>QR Codes Are More Useful Than They Seem</h2><p>Using QR codes around the house is limited only by your imagination. Web apps like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaywa</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goqr</a> make it easy to create and print QR codes quickly. There are also other websites to help you <a href=#>use QR codes differently</a>.</p><p>Remember, QR codes can be used not only for linking you to a website but also for pure information. This will help you figure out how to creatively use QR codes around the house.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fbXqzscClo7Jll5qyrMWMm6ytZZOnsqLAyK%2BcZq%2BRrsBuwM5mrKydXaa%2Fbq%2FOnZysZZGpeqm7zJ5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-leather-pencil-skirt-fuzzy-coat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez Wore Three Fabulous Maximalist Looks in One Day</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mountain-mamas-stars-talk-balancing-their-work-and-families.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mountain Mamas Stars Jackie Wickens and Trecie Wheat Hughes on Balancing Their Work and Famili</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
