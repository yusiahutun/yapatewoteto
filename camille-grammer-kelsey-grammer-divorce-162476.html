On Tuesday June 26, Camille Grammer took to Twitter to open about her current relationship with her ex-husband <a href=#>Kelsey Grammer</a>. And while it does seem as if the pair is mostly civil today, the mother-of-two shared some painful insights that paint Kelsey as a not-so-great guy.</p><p>First, <a href=#>a fan retweeted an article </a>— that quoted Closer Weekly‘s <a href=#>recent exclusive interview </a>with the actor — about Kelsey with the caption, “I’ll never forgive him after what he did to [Camille].” Now, most celebrities wouldn’t take that tweet as an opportunity to open up about their personal life, but Camille saw her window and went for it!</p><p>“I don’t begrudge him his happiness. What’s unnerving is that fact I was there to help him get through some of his hardships and supported his career and his sobriety,” the 49-year-old began. “I was [right] by his side and he acts like I never existed, that’s disappointing. We were together through his success.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-98537125-1.jpg><p>Camille continued by listing all of the ways she was by Kelsey’s side during their 14-year-marriage. “I was there during the writers’ strike and the cancellation of Back to You. We moved the company to our home in Malibu. I sat at his bedside for eight days straight while he was in the cardiac intensive care unit in NYC. I read him poetry and helped washed his hair. Now I don’t exist,” she wrote.</p><p>Despite Camille’s resentments, she concluded on a positive note. “We have two beautiful children from our union and I was blessed to have shared those years of my life with him. We have both moved on. Just wished it ended in a more civil manner,” she expressed. And move on they did — Camille is currently engaged to lawyer David C. Meyer and Kelsey has been married to Kayte Walsh since 2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKahnKGybrPRmqSmnaJiuKa40p6wZp%2BilrqusdFmm6Kun6ewpnmQb2ltb2Zk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./moline-soccer-beats-galesburg-5-1-in-western-big-6-action.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Moline soccer beats Galesburg 5-1 in Western Big 6 action</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wearing-wrong-lip-shade.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are You Wearing the Wrong Lip Shade?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
