After more than two decades of marriage, the actors are still together and going strong. They’ve celebrated career milestones together, had three children and traveled the world. But their relationship hasn’t been without problems.</p><p id=par-2_55>The Smiths have weathered lots of drama together — from CPS investigations to cheating rumors. Most recently, an actor claimed he once got into a verbal altercation with Will over a love scene involving Jada and that they nearly came to blows. He detailed the drama in a new book and did not hold back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Will-Smith-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith.jpg><h2>Tommy Davidson gets candid about his spat with Will Smith</h2><p id=par-3_32>Tommy Davidson — who is best known for his role on the hit sketch comedy show In Living Color — opened up about the argument in his new memoir, Living in Color.</p><p id=par-4_66>In excerpts obtained by <a href=#>Page Six</a>, Davidson says the drama went down on the set of 1998’s Woo, in which he and Jada played love interests. Davidson claims he and Jada were unsatisfied with the original ending and tried to figure out a way to make it better. The actor decided to spruce things up with a kiss but failed to mention it to his co-star.</p><p id=par-5_33>“I didn’t know this: You have to rehearse a kiss,” Davidson writes. “You can’t just spring it on your costar … And I didn’t think it was all that big of a deal.”</p><p id=par-6_36>When he went in for the kiss while they were filming, he claims he felt Jada “flinch.” A short time later, Will allegedly approached him on set and confronted him, telling Davidson, “I didn’t appreciate that.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_38>“Will went all gangsta on me, saying what I did was not cool,” Davidson continues. “There was a moment there when we might have come to blows. My reactive fight-or-flight instinct was triggered and I could have exploded.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Tommy-Davidson-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-1.jpg><h2>Fortunately, Tommy Davidson made amends with the Smiths</h2><p id=par-8_31>According to Davidson, Jada stepped in and helped deescalate the drama before it became physical. The trio went on to make amends and have a friendly relationship to this day.</p><p id=par-9_43>In November 2019, Davidson even appeared on Jada’s Facebook Watch series Red Table Talk and opened up about the time they worked together for Woo. He reflected on a day that was particularly tough for him and how Jada helped him through it.</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_51>“[The] first time that we worked together — and I really got to know you on the set of&nbsp;Woo —&nbsp;I came out for a scene and you looked at me and you said, ‘Something’s wrong with you,’” Davidson recalled. “I was like, ‘What you talking about? Let’s just get to work.’”</p><p id=par-11_16>But Jada could apparently tell that something was wrong and urged him to talk about it.</p><p id=par-12_56>“I said, ‘My mother contacted my real mother and she was on the phone. I got a chance to talk to her but I don’t want to deal with that,’” said Davidson, who was adopted at the age of 2 after <a href=#>his biological mother abandoned him</a>. “She said, ‘Oh really? OK, hold — that’s a wrap!’”</p><p id=par-13_29>He said Jada called off filming for the day so he could deal with the situation. He said it “led from our conversation to finally meeting my real mom.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbXSZqeoqKWhrrN5mGmqZpmTqbyzecKlmKKlo2K1pnnApaSoq6Ris7DBxqGrZq%2BZobluv8yiq6Fln6uys3nJmpuaZaCeu6yx061krKWZqbVvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-briana-de-jesus-hospitalized.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'I Really Thought I Was Dying'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charles-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Queen Elizabeth Inheritance, Royal Salary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
