While some country stars might spring for decadent mansions with rooms to spare, Combs and his wife are — for now, at least — raising their family in a fairly average-sized house. That shouldn't be a huge surprise, since Combs' brand is built on his every-man image and his commitment to staying true to his roots, but fans were still a little surprised to hear that the couple live in a two-bedroom.</p><p>Nicole even rolled her eyes at one user who commented to express their surprise, and said that living below their means in a moderately-sized home seemed "so basic."</p><p>"We're basic AF," Nicole jokes, posting a dramatically filtered selfie with enormous eyes and an exaggerated, frog-like mouth.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Instagram</span></p>Instagram<p>loading...</p></figure><p>But their current living situation won't last forever. In her Q&A, Nicole also&nbsp;explains that the family is planning to move in a few years, which is why she's not planning to make the kids' room "too fancy." In the meantime, there are definite advantages to her two boys sleeping in the same bedroom.</p><p>"I shared a room with my sister growing up and low-key loved it," the singer's wife points out.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Instagram</span></p>Instagram<p>loading...</p></figure><p>Elsewhere in her Instagram Q&A, Nicole&nbsp;admits that she and Combs are having "the hardest time" landing on a name for their second baby boy, who is due in September.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Instagram</span></p>Instagram<p>loading...</p></figure><p>"I like one-syllable names bc I think they're powerful, but every name we like (2 lol) we know someone or someone's child named that already," she continues. "I normally don't care about that, but when it's a close friend it's kind of odd."</p><p>She also answered a question about longterm family planning, saying that she and Combs aren't quite sure how many kids they'll have in total, but they do have a number that they've decided is their maximum.</p><p>"I would like a small army, but we decided on 4 max. But we also may stop at 2. Who knows," she replies.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Instagram</span></p>Instagram<p>loading...</p></figure><p>It's not the first time the Combs' have made headlines for their down-to-earth family life: Some fans have been surprised to hear that, unlike many other celebrities, <a href=#>they don't employ a nanny</a>.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 20 Luke Combs Songs That Prove 'Em All Wrong</h2><p>Check out Luke Combs' best songs, and the songs that changed his life when so many thought he wasn't good enough to be a country star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmavmZuybrrInKalnV2pxLB5wZ6bq6efonqpu9SsnGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mel-tillis-dead-dies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mel Tillis Dead at 85</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./groundbreaking-artist-faith-ringgold-has-died.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Groundbreaking Artist Faith Ringgold Has Died</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
