but it really isn’t because they are not going to gain anything, it just makes it worse.</p><p>“Seeing someone on TV or on Instagram and immediately thinking you own them and you have the right because you see them each day is not ok.</p><p>“At the end of the day, I am going to say this, Babestatoin is an act. We get a call and we get told what they want prior and we either say yes or no and then we act a certain way with the storyline they want.</p><p>“It is an act… I don’t go around feeling horny every minute of every day and definitely not with random people if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Stella is from Malta and she is also known for having<a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow> dated a British man while he was on the run for murder</a> – despite her not knowing about his heinous crime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31387916.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/2_Britains-most-glam-lorry-driver-buys-own-haulage-firm-with-cash-made-from-sexy-pictures.jpg><p>The former radiographer then moved to Britain in 2012 in search of a new life and she now works for Babestation while dedicating her spare time to animal activism.</p><p>But she said being harassed by five lads in a gym last week was one of her lowest moments since making the move from Malta.</p><p>Stella, who is now married, said: “I am going to be 37 this week but it makes me feel anxious and scared for my life. What really scares me to be honest is that I take my training really seriously and then you have an individual, well in this case five people in one go, who intrude on me.</p><p>“They were staring and kind of laughing between each other really loudly and I wanted to show them I could see them… like stop, why are you doing this? I pointed it out to my PT and she said they always acted like this with women.</p><p>“But it is happening quite often, they have toxic male traits and you find them at the gym and they are especially the type of people that listen to the Tate guys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>“They were purposely standing and staring and trying to make me feel vulnerable, trying to make me feel intimidated. In England there are signs in London on the underground saying intrusive staring is illegal.</p><p>“They started coming closer and closer and narrowing their eyes and staring. I am like ‘dude what the f***?’ They didn’t move and just stood there, it was unreal, like a dream. You are doing it on purpose to make the person feel intimidated and trying to exert control over them.</p><p>“Imagine if I was by myself? I know there are cameras but I don’t think they would care and because I have been through stuff before it makes me feel anxious and makes me think of the past and things I have gone through with my exes.”</p><p>And this happened after she had already cancelled her membership at a popular gym when her personal trainer “tricked her” into getting her number before texting to ask if she was single.</p><p>He then started sending images of another male member in the gym called J who later harassed her on Babestation while leaving her messages seen by this publication.</p><p>She said: “I completely freaked out and told him to stop and leave but he didn’t. I logged out and a Babestation tech person blocked his account. Within a few minutes he made another one and pursued tipping and interacting again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31426568.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_missstellaparis_1664199488_2935840552185399014_2292312380.jpg><p>Stella added: “I never mentioned to him that I worked at Babestation but he thought it was within his rights to tip me and call me.</p><p>“At the end of the day as an entertainer I have the right not to perform for someone. I know this person and if for example the person goes to the same supermarket as me or lives in the same area as I do, if he knows my family, there will be certain things I will not overstep and I won’t do.</p><p>“This wasn’t right, we knew each other from the gym so why was he doing this? He was making me feel like a slave like I had to do this but I don’t. This happens more often than people think, people getting recognised from Babestation.”</p><p>As for how she now feels after both incidents, she concluded: “It makes me feel like I don't want to go back to the gym but I am not going to let anyone dictate how I live my life.</p><p>“Gym and training is very important to me and for a woman to feel and be treated like this in this day and age is not alright... I think men who do this should be punished. ”</p><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Lifestyle news straight to your inbox? <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for our free Daily Star Hot Topics newsletter</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGihXajBs7XPZquvZZSku7V5w56qnqqmmnp0fZNrbW9qZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./katherine-blasingame.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Katherine Blasingame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeffrey-epstein-jail-cell-photo-suicide-murder-questions-raised.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeffrey Epstein's Gruesome Autopsy Photos, More Suicide Questions Rai</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
