And when I literally was going through my divorce and trying to make that decision of stepping out of a 30-year marriage, I was terrified mostly," she said before noting that women over a certain age can find love again.</p><p>She and Billy Ray tied the knot in 1993 and share three children together: <a href=#><strong>Miley</strong></a>, Braison, and <a href=#><strong>Noah</strong></a>. Billy Ray also adopted Tish's children from a previous relationship, Brandi and Trace. The pair would ultimately go on to divorce in April 2022 after years of ups and downs.</p><p>Tish continued, "I thought I was going to be alone forever. And that was one of the times that I had the crippling breakdown of anxiety. I joke about it and say I had a complete psychological breakdown. There were 30 days where I was not eating, sleeping, just felt like I was just coming out of my skin. And it was really scary."</p><p>The mom and manager, previously shared that the loss of her mother during the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with her marital problems with Billy Ray, <a href=#><strong>sent her into a tailspin</strong></a>, telling <a href=#><strong>Call Her Daddy</strong></a>'s Alex Cooper that she stayed in the marriage far longer than she should've, due in part to their children.</p><p>"I really didn't want Noah to still be young," Tish admitted, referring to their youngest daughter. "But looking back on it, it would have been much better for her had I left."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a8682a15-c7e6-4291-ae07-79b93e5e66be data-container-ref=toofab:article:3f6773ca-639e-48a1-8691-343371d3253d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/15/5by4/2024/02/07/15dbabc37cb9483499ca722e983edc59_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Miley Cyrus Confirms She Was Wearing Underwear At The Grammys</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Although she admits she should've exited her marriage sooner than she did, Tish said she empathizes with women scared to leave the situation they're in.</p><p>"I get why women are scared to leave, not only bad relationships, [but to] step into new careers and all these things. And I was literally terrified," she said, adding that eventually it felt like a weight lifted from her shoulders.</p><p>"I would love to just be this poster child for women our age and just be like, I promise you starting over sometimes is the best thing you can ever do.
