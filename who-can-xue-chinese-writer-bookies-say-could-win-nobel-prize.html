Canadian writer Anne Carson had remained the bookmakers’ favourite for several days.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The topic “Who is Chinese writer Can Xue?” has been trending on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, with 140 million views.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the buzz around her internationally, Can has won few plaudits in mainland China and her books are rarely available through major online domestic retailers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, her works had been translated in many countries, including Japan, the United States, France, Italy and Germany, and she had been dubbed China’s Franz Kafka, Rednet.cn reported. Some elite Western universities have listed her books as texts for literature students.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Can was born Deng Xiaohua in 1953 in Changsha, capital of the central province of Hunan. Leaving education after primary school, she became – like most people of her generation – a factory worker, and was also a tailor and “barefoot doctor” – an unlicensed village doctor in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her first novel was published in 1985 and she has so far written seven million Chinese characters, in a style that has been referred to as “experimental literature”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pen name Can Xue means “remaining snow” in Chinese. Can has explained that the name has two implications: snow on the top of high mountains, and dirty snow that has been trampled on. The writer has said that she hopes her work can combine the two meanings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the Yangtse Evening News, Chen Xiaozhen, an editor at Can’s publisher Hunan Wenyi Publishing House, has read much of Can’s work but does not claim to understand her. He was quoted as attributing this to Can’s “unlimited imagination, narration that reads like sleep-talking, in addition to fragmented and non-logical stories”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This style [puts off] many readers, but also makes Can Xue unique,” Chen said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Can taught herself English and has been reading the original versions of English novels for the past two decades after thinking that their Chinese translations were inferior.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen said Can had always handwritten her work, and wrote for only an hour per day, producing about 800 to 900 words.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She “does not use a mobile phone or [Chinese social media app] WeChat”, further lowering her profile and deepening the mystery around her, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There has been only one mainland Chinese winner of the Nobel Prize for literature: Mo Yan, in 2012.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Can Xue, in running for Nobel literature award, is barely known within China</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0u8KinK2xX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2Bof3KEl2iuoaddmK6vedeunGabmJ67pr%2FEZq6roaSav26uzqiiop2jYsCixYycpq6klGLEqrqMp6abnZxivbO12Z4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-bryan-spoofs-arrest-halloween-costume.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zach Bryan Spoofs His Arrest With Hilarious Halloween Costume</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-gift-guide-2019.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Beyonc Gift Guide for 2019 Is Beyhive Approved</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
