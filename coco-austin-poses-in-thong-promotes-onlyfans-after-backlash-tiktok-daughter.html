You are the most incredible person I've ever met, the nicest person I've ever met, and the best mother to Chanel that anyone could possibly imagine," he said, causing Coco to get choked up. "I love you to death, 22 years baby, and it gets better every day. Love is love."</p><p>"As a mother, you don't hear that much. You don't hear that much from everybody," said Coco, explaining why the message hit her so hard.</p><p>"I have the whole world and I'm underneath a microscope all the time and you don't hear what good you do," she continued. "You don't hear the goodness, you just hear a lot of bad and I know I'm a good mother because I dedicated the last six years --putting everything aside, my career, everything -- just for her."</p><p>She added that, "you just want a little love, you want a little respect from people."</p><a id=gallery-link-4ac64912-74fc-4abe-a076-d7fc83547a0a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4ac64912-74fc-4abe-a076-d7fc83547a0a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:81772c5e-71e3-46e0-bcdf-d386c5279fd9 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/4by3/2023/06/30/b66a5ffc148146b49ac929582641edc7_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21mamxfmLyku4yarKysmaN6sbvSnqpmoZ5iwam7zaBkqaqfory1sdJmpqekqZuur7%2BMmp2tnaJir6KvyqWYrKBdqbaswM6kZJ2ZpZy1tbHRaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./derek-jeter-and-lara-dutta.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Derek Jeter and Lara Dutta</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-does-ree-drummond-buy-her-blouses-138965.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Does Ree Drummond Buy Her Blouses?
