He started playing professionally when he was 17 with Manchester United and in 2001, David signed a £16million contract to remain with the club for another three years. But in 2003, he ended up signing an even more lucrative deal with Real Madrid. David went on to make history in 2007 when he joined LA Galaxy, earning a reported £753,000 per week for five years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0c3aedff7ce9-gettyimages-492933195.jpg><p id=etDJk4wAE6P data-wc=77>The sports legend, who has been named FIFA World Player of the Year twice, has played for several other teams including AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. Aside from his league career, David was also named captain of the England national football team in 2000. He retained that title for six years. David retired in 2013, but his money didn't dry up. Far from it; he raked in £49 million two years later, thanks to his brand endorsements.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Countless endorsement deals</h3><p id=e9LC2SB3rqZ data-wc=78>David has been the face of dozens of advertising campaigns and sponsorships, promoting the likes of Adidas, Coty, Brylcreem, Armani, H&M, Sainsbury's, Samsung, Vodafone, Breitling, Pepsi, Calvin Klein and Gilette to name a few. His most recent commercial endorsements include whisky brand Haig and luxury watch brand Tudor. David also acted as a brand ambassador for Sky television and Sainsbury's. In 2004, he was named the highest-paid football player, after taking into account his salary and advertising deals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/38297d78e933-david-beckham-speech-inter-miami.jpg><h3>His football team Inter Miami</h3><p id=emtOgbp0bP8 data-wc=71>His latest football project has seen David <a class=hm-link href=#>buy his own Major League Soccer team</a> in Miami. The footballer announced the news in January 2018, saying it had been "a hell of a journey" and promising that "the team we will bring into the league will be the best team". David's business group Beckham Miami United bought a plot of land to build a new stadium, which has a 20,000 seating capacity.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6469e7bd014f-david-beckham-family-nashville.jpg><p id=e3IDaGItvT6 data-wc=139>In August 2018, the sports icon revealed that his Major League Soccer team will be called Club Internacional de Futbol Miami, or Inter Miami CF, and will make their MLS debut in 2020. David took to Instagram to share a photo of the crest, which features two herons and a sun with seven rays - a clear homage to the ex-England captain who wore the number seven when he played for Manchester United and England. David wrote: "Four years ago, we dreamt of a soccer club. Today, we're proud to announce the official name and crest of our new team, Club Internacional de Fútbol Miami. @intermiamicf @mls THIS IS US. THIS IS MIAMI." He added in another post: "We have spent so much time to make sure we got this right for our fans.. A Very proud moment @intermiamicf."</p><h3 dir=ltr>His own companies</h3><p id=e_LByR4iHEm data-wc=83>David has two companies that manage his wealth. According to The Sun, his companies made £71,000 a day in 2016. His business, Seven Global LLP, takes care of the sales from his clothing, accessory and fragrance commercial deals, while Footwork Productions is responsible for his name and image rights. Both companies sit under the umbrella of DB Ventures and DB Ventures' parent company, Beckham Brand Holdings Ltd, which David shares with his wife Victoria and the family's management group headed by Simon Fuller.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/544cd2924515-victoria-david-beckham-boat.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>How does the former Spice Girl make money?</h2><p id=epHdtZNSvH data-wc=37>Victoria earns per year will likely vary a lot depending on what work she does in addition to her work on her fashion brand.

In 2007, she starred alongside her Spice Girls bandmates for a Christmas Tesco advert which netted them £1million each.

Speaking to ES magazine in 2018, David said: "We used to be very extravagant in what we'd buy each other. But we're obviously saving the pennies now because we have so many children to be extravagant with." He added: "So it's the simple things, really. It's more about spending time together, going for a simple dinner together. Having a nice bottle of wine together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b756c30b439-beckham-family-xmas.jpg><p id=e4bd-U12VXQ data-wc=76>David has also previously shared his worries about his children growing up spoilt. He told The Times: "They've got a great life set up for them. Obviously, our boys and little girl are very lucky. But I think, as a parent, you always worry, 'Have they got that hunger that I had as a kid?'" The family man added: "We make sure that the most important thing to us is our family and we're all grounded."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ekrZp7MuSYU data-wc=124>His wife Victoria, who also came from a modest background, has the same attitude. Speaking about the importance of working hard, the former Spice Girl said: "It's never been an option not to work hard. <a class=hm-link href=#>They see mummy go to work</a>, they see daddy go to work, and they go to school and they have to work. But at the same time they're happy children. I believe that children should be children, and have fun." Their eldest son Brooklyn has worked in a café, with Victoria revealing: "He's worked in the local café cleaning up dishes for the last two years, which I think is great. It's important that the kids have a good work ethic and try to help other people as well."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dnyVbnBxZ5SWw6qwjK%2BgnKyfp7aiecGemqSgkaJ6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lawrence-sheer-gown-2022-toronto-film-festival.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lawrence Wore a Sheer Gown for Her Post-Baby Red Carpet Debut</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./giancarlo-stanton-wife-girlfriend-parents-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Giancarlo Stanton Married, Parents, Salary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
