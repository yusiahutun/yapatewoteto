The original picture was a pair of black-and-white shots of Reid clearly feeling herself in a fun patterned two-piece.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cd732a53-c1ed-429c-83aa-3398e6b31a25 data-container-ref=toofab:article:73d21194-5790-46fc-8d7d-e53942273ccc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d7/5by4/2020/07/21/d78c4def3b644223b76a390c676bdce9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tara Reid on Overcoming Bullying from Trolls, the Media and Even Hollywood Peers (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The hate came so quick, though, that Reid wound up commenting on her own post on Tuesday, asking people to stop coming at her with their body-shaming comments.</p><p>"Stop hating start loving ❤️," she wrote. "no one needs to be body shaming it’s not right it’s not cool and it hurts people. Please don’t be one of those people, it does have an affect."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>One day later, though, Reid was back on Instagram, this time with a new post and a new message directed at those who felt the need to comment on her body. "To all who made their great comments exposing their hate for my artsy picture I posted yesterday, it was the angle," she wrote alongside a new full-color snap in the same bikini.</p><p>"Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny, I have a high metabolism," she continued. "Anyone with a high metabolism understands it’s impossible to gain weight. All I do is eat."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f318c77e-05d4-48a1-90fd-0d9d6b23f667 data-container-ref=toofab:article:73d21194-5790-46fc-8d7d-e53942273ccc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3c/5by4/2021/10/14/3c59aafccf56414e9a283bbfa9dee179_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jonah Hill Asks Fans to Stop Talking About His Body: 'It's Not Helpful and Doesn't Feel Good'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She went on to share her appreciation for all of the fans who did stand up to her, adding, "To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world."</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that the haters appear to have gotten into her head enough that she not only felt the need to respond again, she felt the need to justify her original picture, push back against their totally inappropriate claims about her body and defend herself.</p><p>Among those she was grateful for were <a href=#>Ian Ziering</a>, who commented, "You look great Tara!" and <a href=#>Taryn Manning</a>, who took the photos and commented, "No one deserves this level of vitriol."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:446f227b-b590-4343-8512-350d4fa35cd9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:73d21194-5790-46fc-8d7d-e53942273ccc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f6/5by4/2021/10/07/f6f4e25de3f24bac8c4603b164254c6c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">British Vogue: Steven Meisel</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Adele Says She was 'Hurt' By 'Brutal' Comments from Women About Her Weight Loss</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>This past summer, Reid opened up to <a href=#>TooFab</a> about enduring online bullying for the past two decades, starting with the celebrity websites in the 2000s and evolving into today's social media trolls, like the ones who love to light up IG comments with their hate.</p><p>"The cyber bullying that's going on, with weight, if you're gay, lesbian ... there's so much racism, it just needs to stop," she said. "It has to be so much more controlled. Social media's a very dangerous thing."</p><p>"America just beats on each other," she added. "They love to build you up and then destroy you."</p><p>Reid's solution for the onslaught of ugliness -- personally, professionally and anonymously online -- is to surround yourself with a strong support system. "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," she said.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGlma3Bfqa6zrYyrnKKcXZi5orzSZpmam5tir7Cw2GaqoZmdmr%2B0edOopmarm567r8WMm6CkoZ6eerG1wmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./unexploded-ied-found-shenzhen-border-control-point.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Unexploded IED found at Shenzhen border control point, after suspected bomb destroys second Hong Kon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julianne-hough-crop-top-ethereal-selfie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julianne Hough stuns in crop top in ethereal selfie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
