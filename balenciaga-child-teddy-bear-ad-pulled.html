The company also issued a statement to its Instagram Story.</p><p>"We sincerely apologize for any offense our holiday campaign may have caused. Our plush bear bags should not have been featured with children in this campaign," it began. "We have immediately removed the campaign from all platforms."</p><p>"We apologize for displaying unsettling documents in our campaign. We take this matter very seriously and are taking legal action against the parties responsible for creating the set and including unapproved items for our Spring 23 campaign photoshoot," they continued. "We strongly condemn abuse of children in any form. We stand for children safety and well-being."</p><p>Galimberti <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement of his own on Wednesday</a>, claiming he was simply told to point and shoot, in the style of his Toy Stories series.</p><p>"Following the hundreds of hate mails and messages I received as a result of the photos I took for the Balenciaga campaign, I feel compelled to make this statement," he began. "I am not in a position to comment Balenciaga's choices, but I must stress that I was not entitled in whatsoever manner to neither chose the products, nor the models, nor the combination of the same."</p><p>"As a photographer, I was only and solely requested to lit the given scene, and take the shots according to my signature style," he added. "As usual for a commercial shooting, the direction of the campaign and the choice of the objects displayed are not in the hands of the photographer."</p><p>He also said he has "no connection with the photo where a Supreme Court document appears," saying it was "taken in another set by other people and and was falsely associated with my photos."</p><a id=gallery-link-6ef76c80-81e5-456b-b2bd-7aad6a34ff6e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:6ef76c80-81e5-456b-b2bd-7aad6a34ff6e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c6ebefec-6cdd-4d39-ad8a-f9f45d92404f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c6/4by3/2022/05/23/c688bad947c741209e41851baa923bfc_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpma2tfl66tsc2coJqfkWKwqbXLnWStnZSZxm6uxJqpZpmUYr22uMuem2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-ridah-by-2pac.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Ridah by 2Pac</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./second-student-16-19-000-year-jesuit-prep-school-jumps-train-two-weeks-leaving-thousands-stranded-grand-central-rush-hour-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Second Fordham Prep school student jumps in front of a train in New York</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
