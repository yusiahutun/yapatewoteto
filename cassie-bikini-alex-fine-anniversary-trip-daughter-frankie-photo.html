On Sept. 1, Cassie took to Instagram to share photos of their low-key weekend together, which included the sweetest pic of herself cradling the pair’s daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Frankie</strong>, 9 months, while wearing a bikini. She also wrote a lengthy tribute to Alex and Frankie to go with the family pics.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I can’t explain the amount of unconditional love and adoration that I have for my family,” she wrote. “I wake up everyday so thankful and happy to have my own. I will never take it for granted and will always feel honored to be able to experience this kind of love .Slowing down and simply enjoying each other has been a motto for us. We don’t need a lot, everything we need is right here.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Cassie added that she, Alex and Frankie took a road trip for the one-year anniversary vacation, and gushed that she “enjoyed every moment of it.” She also vowed that there will be “more adventures to come” after the successful weekend away.

She previously dated&nbsp;<strong>Diddy</strong> on and off from 2007 until 2018, but when they broke up for good, she began dating Alex at the end of 2018. They confirmed that they were expecting a child together in June 2019. Alex popped the question in August, and they were married just weeks later. However, it wasn’t until <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the end of September</a> that news about Cassie and Alex’s super secret Malibu wedding went public.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Now, the two are one year into their marriage, and it appears that they could not be happier! In the months since Frankie’s birth, Alex has been a source of encouragement and support for Cassie, and he gushed over how proud he was of her in an Instagram post in August. “She worked hard, was patient and stayed consistent,”<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> he wrote</a>, regarding Cassie’s post-baby body. “Postpartum is very difficult with time, energy, hormone levels etc….but super proud of how Cassie handled adversity and worked towards a goal and achieved it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH16e49qZpyZo6i2pnnBoqKipplirq2x12adoqaVYq6vusivnKurkafGbsDRoqdmnJGqtKnAxKtkn6qRo7iqsYypn6isn2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-53062646-48d4-11ee-a70b-7f1974975483-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dixie Electric workers head to Florida to help | News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./courteney-cox-regrets-not-being-firmer-parent-daughter-coco.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Courteney Cox Regrets Not Being a 'Firmer Parent' to Daughter Coco, 19</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
