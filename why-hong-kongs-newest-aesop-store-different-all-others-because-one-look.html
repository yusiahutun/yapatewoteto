These parts do not vary across our stores.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even in the early stages of Paphitis’ career , his eye for design was obvious, with his hair salon evoking a serene sanctuary and products packaged in plain pharmaceutical-style bottles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jeremy Barbour of New York’s Tacklebox Architecture admits he was surprised to find himself invited to Australia after his studio was approached by Paphitis to pitch a design for a small temporary kiosk in New York’s Grand Central station.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From the minute I stepped onto their home turf the conversations were about art, literature and food – everything other than their product,” Barbour recalls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Other clients sell who they are, but we had a lot of conversations about what they have an affinity for, so we didn’t have a contrived surface reading of their values. Instead, we got an idea about what is at the core of the brand.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/05/bc0230dc-41e6-11e7-8c27-b06d81bc1bba_1320x770_112645.jpg>Barbour’s studio subsequently went on to design one of Aesop’s most famous stores, the newspaper-inspired store in Nolita (North of Little Italy) featuring walls clad with 2,800 copies of The New York Times. The studio is also responsible for the recently opened store in San Francisco, with interiors inspired by the stills used to produce whiskey in the same area.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other designers who have worked with the brand say that although Paphitis is notoriously fastidious about design details, in general they enjoy considerable creative freedom. Although renowned designers, such as Studioilse and Torafu Architects, are responsible for some of Aesop’s stores, the brand has a tradition of hiring young, emerging architects. In 2015, the brand launched “Taxonomy of Design”, a digital archive of its stores with profiles and filmed interviews with some of their designers, alongside details of materials and furnishings.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Uncovering the design secrets behind Cathay Pacific’s new business class lounge</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Approaching each space with a different design strategy is not for the faint of heart. It is an expensive, high-risk strategy that flies in the face of traditional economies of scale. The advantages, however, extend beyond pure aesthetics to provide greater flexibility regarding reuse of building and decorative materials. Many of Aesop’s interiors incorporate vintage or salvaged items, such as sinks, taps and tiling, in novel ways.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For example, at Chicago’s Bucktown store, Norman Kelley created a distinctive grid motif comprised of reclaimed Chicago common bricks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the newly renovated Aesop store in the IFC, Paphitis says he challenged the newly established local design studio Mlkk to investigate recyclable materials for a design that could be easily updated. After research into regional timbers, the team of young designers came up with an organic, Chinese eucalyptus, cork-lined interior featuring a curvilinear counter.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Aesop GM Suzanne Santos says avoiding clichés is key</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Cork is a very sustainable, humble material that offers a contrast to the shininess of the mall, but at the same time we also wanted a design that would offer a high-end aesthetic quality,” Mlkk co-founder Kian Yam says. Yam worked as an in-house architect at Aesop before co-founding the studio.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Paphitis is no longer involved in day-to-day management of the design of each store, he remains a key strategic creative force within the business.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As digital grows we can be even more selective in our stand-alone stores as the purpose of them extends to include other things like customer events,” Aesop chief executive Michael O’Keeffe says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our customers replenish stocks online but go into the stores because of the relationships. It is not just about the product and experience of design; it also extends to service with a human touch. Digital will become the connector between all of this.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Aesop pop-up is the result of a happy ‘accidental friendship’</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/05/ad2e4942-41e6-11e7-8c27-b06d81bc1bba_1320x770_112645.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although all Aesop stores are designed to reflect their local context, the brand’s latest project – a beauty pop-up on Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris that runs until July – is all about disconnecting from time and place.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">This was not a brand ‘collaboration’ but more of an accidental friendship that evolved into a personal experimentDennis Paphitis</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to owner Dennis Paphitis, the idea arose when Benjamin Paulin, son of the late avant-garde French designer Pierre Paulin, was passing Aesop’s store in the Rue Condorcet in Paris, and spotted a vintage armchair designed by his father. The chair had been chosen by the company’s in-house designer, Jean-Philippe Bonnefoi, and reupholstered in nude coral pink.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paulin inquired about the interest in his father’s work, and he and Bonnefoi hit upon the idea of transforming the company’s temporarily empty office space into a treatment space decorated with Pierre Paulin’s designs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This was not a brand ‘collaboration’ but more of an accidental friendship that evolved into a personal experiment,” Paphitis says. “This is not something that could have been strategised.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pop-up, which Paphitis says “feels like you’ve walked into an apartment of an older Parisian couple”, comprises three understated, serene rooms in neutral tones of mushroom and taupe, furnished with Paulin’s furniture and lighting.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Aesop debuts beauty pop-up in Paris</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first space is an entrance reception and features Paulin’s Tanis desk and Anda chair, produced by Ligne Roset. Bonnefoi designed an LED-lit wall of 12 wax panels made from melted-down church candles that diffuses the natural daylight in the middle room.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The third room is where the treatment takes place and includes a leather Elysée chair and a pair of (soon to be reissued) vintage Elysée floor lamps.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is not an exhibition of Paulin furniture because each piece comes from a different time and was chosen to be functional and to help create a special atmosphere,” Paulin says. “It also offers a new kind of organic environment that is not at all clinical.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: uniformly different</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwMico55nYmWGd3yXbmawoKlitbC6xmaiqKaXqHqvsdaeqq1lkZrAsLyMrKuoqpVisaqyxZ6pnqakYq6tuIyoq6Gdoqh6o7HCmqysnV2ku6Z5y6impA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mixed-nuts-nutrition-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Mixed Nuts Nutrition Facts About This Popular Snack</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez: news and photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
