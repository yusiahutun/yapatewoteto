According to the website, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twin Flames Universe’s teachings</a> include concepts such as “mirror work” (self-reflection), healing childhood wounds, forgiveness, and unconditional love.</p><p>Followers believe that the union with their twin flame brings about personal growth, spiritual transformation, and a deeper understanding of love and connection.</p><p>But in the Netflix documentary series, several former Twin Flames Universe members testified how they were manipulated or convinced into crossing boundaries with the people Jeff had selected as their twin flames; with one woman being issued a restraining order and a night in jail.</p><p>While outwardly supporting LGBTQ+ members, it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coerced some women</a> into gender transitioning; pushing the idea that humans were either “Divine Masculine” or “Divine Feminine.” If their mostly female members couldn’t find a man, it was because they themselves were “Divine Masculine” in nature—and therefore should begin a gender transition.</p><p>Twin Flames Universe founders made the following statement on their website, defending their group and mission. “Our primary objective continues to be the development of a community that is both diverse and inclusive, joined together by common values, principles, and goals. Those who enter our community and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>become students are treated</a> with love, acceptance, and support. This will never change, and we continue to love those who have moved on and wish only the best for those who ultimately decide to follow their journey elsewhere.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/escaping-twin-flames-2.png><p>“Our organization is staffed by a multidisciplinary team of experts, including PhD researchers and educators from around the globe, all coming together with unique experiences and backgrounds. Each of us has dedicated ourselves wholly to ethical conduct and the welfare of our community.”</p><p>“We’d like to emphasize that our educational content and methodologies are tailored to provide a unique path for both personal and spiritual development and fulfillment. We recognize our methods may not align with everyone’s unique beliefs or needs, and we honor the freedom of individuals to explore other options they feel best elevate their spiritual well-being. We are devoted to ongoing refinement and welcome meaningful conversations with all interested parties.”</p><p>“We take seriously recent allegations implying we wield inappropriate control over our community members. After a careful review of both media coverage and recent productions, we are saddened that so much effort has gone into taking swipes at an organization and community founded on love and mutual respect.”</p><p>“The allegations levied against Twin Flames Universe not only distort our true aims, methods, and curriculums but also misrepresent the autonomy of our community members, who are free to engage with our resources as they see fit. We are committed to confronting these allegations in an open and accountable manner.”</p><p>The statement concluded: “Twin Flames Universe will continue to foster an atmosphere of open discussion. We welcome constructive feedback, as these are crucial for mutual growth and understanding. Our unwavering commitment is to maintain a secure, respectful, and uplifting space for anyone who wishes to join or engage with our community.”</p><p>Marina Zenovich, director who created another Twin Flames Universe documentary, this time for Prime Video titled, Desperately Seeking Soulmate: Escaping Twin Flames Universe, observed to Variety that “<a href=#>taking a group like this down</a> is really hard because everything is done so secretively. But who knows? Maybe this will.&nbsp;Unless I’m mistaken, there are no laws that can help cult survivors. I think that’s really the next step with something like this. Instead of shining a light on all these different groups, it’s about lawmakers writing a bill that protects people (involved in cults) because they have no protection.”</p><p><strong>Escaping Twin Flames is available to stream on Netflix.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqcSquoyfo5qllah6trrIr5yrq5ViwLW1y6VkmpuknsOmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./that-dog-wont-hunt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>That Dog Won't Hunt Laurel Mercantile</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./davenport-man-18-faces-attempted-murder-other-charges-after-gunfire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Davenport man, 18, faces attempted murder, other charges after gunfire</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
