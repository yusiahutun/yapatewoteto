The Mamma Mia actress told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hollywood Streams</a> that the correct pronunciation is sigh-frid, despite what her own sister says.</p><h2>Ariana Grande (Pronounced: Gran-Dee)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ariana_name.jpg><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Beats 1</a>‘s Ebro Darden, Grande left us shook when she announced her name is actually pronounced Ariana gran-dee—not grahn-day. The common way we all say Grande’s last name was established by her own brother, Frankie. Though Grande pronounced her last name as grandee all her life growing up. There’s also some debate on how the name is actually pronounced, given that Grande is pronounced as grahn-day in Italian, but in the Grande family, its pronunciation is gran-dee.</p><h2>Rihanna (Pronounced: Ree-Anna)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rihanna_name.jpg><p>The Fenty Beauty owner confirmed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">HLN</a> that the pronunciation of her name is ree-anna—not ree-AH-na.

Cabello pronounces her first name kam-ee-lah and her last name kuh-bay-oh. The two Ls in her last name make the&nbsp;y&nbsp;sound, as is the case in Spanish.</p><h2>Charlize Theron (Pronounced: There-In)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/charlize_name.jpg><p>Theron shared that the proper way to pronounce her last name was there-in not there-own during an appearance on&nbsp;T<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">he Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>.&nbsp;The Atomic Blonde&nbsp;star also said her last name is almost always mispronounced.</p><h2>Milo Ventimiglia (Pronounced: Ven-Teh-Meal-Ee-Uh)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/milo_name.jpg><p>The This Is Us star has a silent G in his name, as seen in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">How to Pronounce</a> video, which can confuse fans who don’t know how to pronounce it. Aside from the G, Ventimiglia is actually very simple to pronounce compared to other actors’ names.</p><h2>Chrissy Teigen (Pronounced: Tie-Ghen)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chrissy_name.jpg><p>Teigen admitted on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Live With Kelly and Ryan</a> that her Norwegian last name is actually pronounced tie-ghen—not tee-ghen. Even though Teigen has introduced herself as tee-ghen, her family members told her the proper way to pronounce her last name at home—and in Norway—is tie-ghen.</p><h2>Emily Ratajkowski (Pronounced: Ratuh-Kow-Skee)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/emrata_name.jpg><p>The American model and actress has a lengthy surname, but similar to Ventimiglia, Ratajkowski’s name is simple to pronounce once the silent J has been learned.</p><h2>Gal Gadot (Pronounced: Guh-Dote)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gal_name.jpg><p>Gadot’s last name is commonly mispronounced, according to the Wonder Woman star.

Many fans refer to the actor as jill-en-hall, but it’s definitely a lot more complicated than that.</p><h2>Liev Schrieber (Pronounced: Lee-Ev)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/liev_name.jpg><p>Schreiber is best known for his role on Ray Donovan and as Victor Creed in X-Men Origins.&nbsp;What you may not know is how to pronounce Schreiber’s first name.
