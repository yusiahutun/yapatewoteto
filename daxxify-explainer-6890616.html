As the first innovation in the market in years, it's getting plenty of buzz — mainly because it lasts longer than its predecessors (more on that below). But how much does Daxxify cost, and what should you consider before getting the treatment?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We turned to medical professional Allie McAllister to find out.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for your complete guide to the game-changing neuromodulator, Daxxify.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-daxxify></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Daxxify?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Daxxify is the same neurotoxin we're all familiar with and have been using with Dysport, Botox, and Xeomin," explained McCallister. "The key difference is that there is a peptide attached to the neurotoxin. We believe that is what is allowing more of the active ingredients to be absorbed by the muscles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Daxxify is approved to treat frown lines,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>crow's feet</a>, and forehead wrinkles, just like the neurotoxins you're used to getting, and can also be used to decrease sweating in your palms and armpits and even injected into your head to help decrease migraines — just like its predecessors.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-its-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who It's For</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Any patient who is a candidate for neurotoxins in general is a candidate for Daxxify. That means it's a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>no-go if you're pregnant</a>&nbsp;or nursing, but otherwise, you've got a green light.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes people's bodies will build up a resistance to Botox, and they'll stop getting their usual three to four months out of it," said McAllister. So, if you've noticed that your Botox or Dysport isn't lasting as long as it used to, Daxxify might be exactly what you need.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-daxxify-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Daxxify Results</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Botox and Dysport typically last three to four months, Daxxify lasts, on average, six months for patients. People are also finding that it kicks in more quickly as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The very first patient that I injected with Daxxify was one of my friends who came in from out of town," shared McAllister. "We could see it working in her forehead the very next day."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Considering it usually takes a minimum of three or four days to see the initial results of Botox and up to 10 days for full results, the accelerated timeline Daxxify offers is a big plus.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-daxxify-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Daxxify Cost</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because it lasts longer, you can expect Daxxify to cost roughly 50 percent more than what you're paying for Botox. So, if you're paying $13 per unit of Botox, you will likely pay around $20 per unit of Daxxify.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-consider-before-getting-daxxify></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Consider Before Getting Daxxify&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From longer-lasting results to kicking in sooner, the benefits of Daxxify are seemingly endless, but are there any downsides to the 'tox?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Since your results will last longer, it is of the utmost importance that you go to a trusted provider with lots of experience with your unique anatomy," suggested McAllister. "I've been injecting Daxxify in patients I see regularly. People whose 'recipe' of where and how much Botox or Dysport we inject is perfected."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-daxxify-vs-botox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Daxxify vs. Botox</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All neurotoxins need a stabilizer to help facilitate their journey into your muscles, and Botox and Dysport use proteins for that job. Daxxify, however, uses a peptide, making it the first of its kind. Not only is that peptide making Daxxify last longer, but it also means that Daxxify is the first vegan neurotoxin on the market. Of course, we know that&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>peptides</a>&nbsp;are frequently used in our topical skin care to help hydrate, tighten, and firm the skin, so Daxxify's origin story isn't all that surprising.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To develop a topical product that offers the same results as Botox, scientists attached a peptide to the neurotoxin, hoping it would help guide the neurotoxin through the skin and into the muscle. While they didn't succeed in creating a topical Botox replacement, they discovered that when injected, their creation offered superior wrinkle-reducing results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Daxxify offering so many positives, will it soon push Botox out as queen of the neurotoxins? McAllister said no — at least for now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't see it as a Botox replacement at this time, but it will be interesting to see where the market goes," she said. "Now that Daxxify has FDA approval and is working so well, it's going to be a big inspiration for other companies, and I think we're about to see an explosion of similar neuromodulators hit the market."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w5qvsaGWrnqmxM%2BlmKKmlad6d4SYaW1qbg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dead-poets-espresso-out-and-about.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dead Poets Espresso | Out and About</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./419891-50-unique-baby-names-death-males-females-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>50+ unique baby names that mean death for males and females</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
