So they never take the opportunity to tour for granted&nbsp;— and they're getting that chance once again in 2024.</p><p>On Thursday (March 21), the group announced a lineup of dates billed as the 2024 Roll On II North American Tour, a reprisal of their 2023 tour of the same name. It's a nod to the band's "Roll On (Eighteen Wheeler)," a hit from 1984, as well as a fitting name for a tour presented by Kenworth Trucking Company.</p><p>In a statement, frontman Randy Owen says fans who attend a show in 2024 can look forward to singing along to all their favorite Alabama hits.</p><p>"I look forward to singing 'Mountain Music,' 'Tennessee River,' 'Feels So Right' and so many more," Owen relates in a statement. "It's just a matter of getting up onstage and enjoying it. We can't wait to see the fans who made it all possible."</p><p>For many of the shows, the band will have some extra musical pals along to make the moment even more special. <a href=#>Diamond Rio</a>, the Marshall Tucker Band, <a href=#>Jamey Johnson</a>, <a href=#>Lee Greenwood</a> and the <a href=#>Bellamy Brothers</a> are all booked to perform on various dates on the tour.</p><p>In late 2023, Owen gave Taste of Country a <a href=#>positive update on his health</a>, but he stopped short of committing to tour plans for 2024.</p><p>"I'm 73 years old. I just had my tests and everything, and everything came back really good. I had my flu shot. So I'm ready to go," he said at that time, but added that the health setbacks he's suffered in the past have left him cautious&nbsp;— and appreciative of every chance he gets to set foot onstage.</p><p>"I just never know. I enjoy every show and thank God I get to do one more show," Owen added.</p><p>For ticketing information for Alabama's upcoming tour dates, visit the band's <a href=#>website</a>. More dates are expected to be announced at a later time.</p><p><strong>Alabama, 2024 Roll On II North America Tour Dates:</strong></p><p>March 23&nbsp;— Thackerville, Okla. @ Lucas Oil Live<br>April 5&nbsp; —&nbsp;Clearwater, Fla. @ The Sound at Coachman Park (with Diamond Rio)<br>April 7&nbsp;— Hollywood, Fla. @ Hard Rock Live at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino<br>April 25&nbsp;— Norfolk, Va. @ Chartway Arena (with Lee Greenwood)<br>April 27&nbsp;— Hershey, Pa. @ Giant Center (with Lee Greenwood)<br>May 11&nbsp;— Orange Beach, Ala. @ The Wharf Amphiteatre (with Jamey Johnson)<br>May 17&nbsp;— Council Bluffs, Iowa @ Stir Concert Cove - Harrah’s Council Bluffs Casino & Hotel<br>May 19&nbsp;— Moline, Ill. @&nbsp; Vibrant Arena at the Mark (with the Bellamy Brothers)<br>June 1&nbsp;— Fort Payne, Ala. @ June Jam XVIII<br>June 15&nbsp;— Columbia, S.C. @ Southeastern BBQ Showdown at Segra Park<br>June 22&nbsp;— Gay, GA @ Long Leaf Country Music Festival (with The Marshall Tucker Band)<br>June 27&nbsp;— Fort Yates, N.D. @ Prairie Knights Casino & Resort<br>June 29&nbsp;— Dauphin, Manitoba, Calif. @ Dauphin’s CountryFest<br>July 25&nbsp;— Columbus, Ohio @ Ohio State Fair<br>July 27&nbsp;— Gethsemane, Ky. @ The Amp at Log Still (with Lee Greenwood)<br>Aug. 8&nbsp;— Selbyville, Dele. @ Freeman Arts Pavilion<br>Aug. 10&nbsp;— Doswell, Va. @ Atlantic Union Bank After Hours at Servpro Pavilion<br>Sept. 13&nbsp;— Stateline, Nev. @ Lake Tahoe Outdoor Arena at Harveys<br>Nov. 8&nbsp; —&nbsp;St. Augustine, Fla. @ St. Augustine Amphitheatre<br>Nov. 9&nbsp;— St. Augustine, Fla. @ St. Augustine Amphitheatre</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Most Popular Country Album From the Year You Were Born</h2><p>Find out which country singer dominated on this list of the most popular albums from the year you were born or graduated high school.</p><p>This list is based on sales date from the Soundscan era (1991 to 2022) and total weeks spent atop Billboard's Hot Country Albums chart (1964-1990).</p>In 1999, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shania Twain</a>'s Come on Over album became the first to top the year-end chart in back-to-back years, but that feat has been done four times since, most recently in 2022.
