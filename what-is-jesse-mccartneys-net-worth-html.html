He had a number of <a href=#>radio hits</a> that many fans still remember to this day and attracted a lot of female followers for his good looks.</p><p id=par-2_49>Although McCartney is no longer a huge star like he was back then, there are no doubt people who wonder how much money he has made since becoming a pop singer. Read on below to find out what McCartney’s net worth is and what he is up to now.</p><h2>Jesse McCartney started out in a boy band</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jesse-McCartney.jpg><p id=par-3_31>McCartney’s career started in 1999 when he joined the boy band Dream Street alongside four other teenage guys. The group released one album and a few singles from 1999 to 2002.</p><p id=par-4_41>However, Dream Street’s career came to a halt in mid-2002 when the members’ parents <a href=#>sued</a> the band’s creators,&nbsp;Louis Baldonieri and Brian Lukow, for engaging “in a wide range of conduct and activities that plainly threaten and impair the minors’ well-being.”</p><p id=par-5_17>The lawsuit claimed that Baldonieri and Lukow were exposing the youngsters to things like alcohol and pornography.</p><p id=par-6_31>Meanwhile, Baldonieri and Lukow denied the charges, with Baldonieri saying that the parents who sued were “teaching kids you can sign anything, then lie, cheat, and defame people for your benefit.”</p><p id=par-7_20>In August 2002, the court ruled against Baldonieri and Lukow, effectively releasing McCartney and his band members from their contract.</p><h2>Jesse McCartney became a star with his solo music</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_23>While things did not work out well for Dream Street, McCartney soon proved that he could become a star all on his own.</p><p id=par-9_52>In 2004, McCartney released his first album,&nbsp;Beautiful Soul, which ended up charting at number 15 on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum. The album came with one of his most famous songs yet – “Beautiful Soul” – as well as other released tracks like “She’s No You” and “Because You Live.”</p><p id=par-10_33>In the following years, McCartney continued to come out with more music. He had a number of other radio hits like “Right Where You Want Me,” “Leavin’,” “How Do You Sleep?,” and “Shake.”</p><p id=par-11_17>He also worked closely with Disney and had many songs in soundtracks for Disney movies and shows.</p><h2>Jesse McCartney also did some acting work</h2><p id=par-12_19>McCartney was not just a singer, however. He has proven himself capable of taking on acting work as well.</p><p id=par-13_27>From 1998 to 2001, he played JR Chandler in the soap opera&nbsp;<a href=#>All My Children</a>.&nbsp;From 2004 to 2005, he also had a main role in the short-lived show&nbsp;Summerland.</p><p id=par-14_24>Since 2007, he has been the voice of Theodore in the&nbsp;Alvin and the Chipmunks film series as well as Terrence in the&nbsp;Disney Fairies franchise.</p><h2>What is Jesse McCartney up to now?</h2><p id=par-15_35>Although it has been a while since McCartney last had a song on the radio, he is still releasing music every few years. In 2018, he released two singles – “Better with You” and “Wasted.”</p><p id=par-16_32>Fans of McCartney can actually still watch him perform live.
