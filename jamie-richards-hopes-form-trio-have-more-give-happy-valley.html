He won three in Class Five last season and everyone sort of thought that was his limit.</p><p>“He’s continued to step up since he’s been with us, so he could be another nice chance. He seems to be pretty honest.”</p><p>Armour Eagle represents Richards in the Class Three Chater Handicap (1,200m) and faces a rematch against Bon’s A Pearla.</p><p>Armour Eagle came out on top by half a length under James McDonald when the pair met over course and distance last time and that form looks solid, with Bon’s A Pearla making a quick turnaround to win at the Valley on her latest start a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>Richards feels his six-year-old is again likely to run well but is concerned that the handicapper may have his measure.</p><p>“He won well last time,” Richards said. “He got back down to his rating and now he’s got to go back up again.</p><p>“He’s got to get a nice run. If he can do that he can be competitive again, but it doesn’t get any easier for him when the handicapper puts him up again.”</p><p>Colourful Baron is another runner Richards inherited from Gibson and the five-year-old finally got his head in front last time on his 21st start in Hong Kong.</p><p>That victory came at Sha Tin but Richards is switching Colourful Baron back to the Valley for the Class Five Murray Handicap (1,800m) and feels he could be his best chance of coming away from the meeting with a winner.</p><p>“He could have a few rating points in hand,” Richards said. “He’s a European horse who has taken a while to work it all out.”</p><p>Away from his last-start winners, Richards runs Enfolded and Happy United in the Class Three Hong Kong Club Challenge Cup (1,000m), Dan Attack in section two of the Club Handicap and Casa Cosmo in the Class Four Jackson Handicap (1,800m).</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6TcW1sbl%2Bfrq61xGapopuYlr%2Blv4yhpqmdo2KzsL7MZquroZ9itaLCxGakqKqVYrSqwsRmn5qooK56t63LpZyy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-inside-out-podcast-with-paul-mecurio-ric-prado-cia-black-ops-officer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Inside Out Podcast With Paul Mecurio: Ric Prado CIA Black Ops Officer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./agts-howie-mandel-looks-completely-unrecognizable-with-new-hair-sends-fans-into-meltdown.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AGTs Howie Mandel looks completely unrecognizable with new hair, sends fans into meltdown</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
