He is a Major League Baseball player for the Los Angeles Dodgers and recently played for the Atlanta Braves organization since being chosen straight out of high school in 2007. Freddie also made his Major League Baseball debut in 2010 and is a three-time All-Star.</p><h3>Early Life&nbsp;</h3><p>Freddie Freeman was born in Fountain Valley, California, to Canadian parents on September 12, 1989. His mother Rosemary is from Peterborough, and his father Fredrick is from Windsor. Freeman has dual citizenship because his parents were both born in Canada. Rosemary died of melanoma when Freeman was ten years old, and he was raised by his father from that point on. Andrew and Phillip Branstine, his older brothers, are tennis players, as is Carson Branstine, his cousin. Freeman comes from a line of Salvationists that dates back six generations. Frederick Charles Freeman has excelled in school since he was a child, earning high grades. He started high school when he was 16 years old.</p><p>Frederick Charles Freeman earned a bachelor’s degree from a public US state institution after finishing high school. El Modena High School was where Freddie began his playing career. His Major League Baseball career began when he was selected #78 overall in the 2007 MLB draught by the Atlanta Braves. Clay Hensley of the Florida Marlins gave him his first MLB hit on September 5, 2010. The Braves first baseman, Freeman, started the 2011 season as the starter. His play improved after a poor start, and he was touted as a strong contender for Rookie of the Year. Freeman led the National League in sacrifice flies with nine in 2012, and he also led the league in batting average.</p><h3>Freddie Freeman Career</h3><p>Freddie Freeman was a finalist for the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game Final Vote, which he won with a record-breaking total of 19.7 million fan votes, however, he was unable to play due to a thumb injury he sustained three days prior to the game. Freeman agreed to a $135 million, eight-year contract extension on February 4, 2014. For the second year in a row, Freeman was named an All-Star, and he pitched the final three innings of the game. In addition, Freeman set a new team mark for innings pitched. With an injury to his right wrist sustained during a game against the New York Mets on June 13, Freeman was listed as day-to-day. Freeman was placed on the 15-day disabled list and soon after underwent a platelet-rich plasma injection.</p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>Freddie Freeman played in the 2017 World Baseball Classic for Canada, which he had always wanted to do. Aaron Loup of Toronto hit Freeman with a pitch, forcing him to leave the game. A non-displaced wrist fracture in his left hand was discovered after an MRI and CT scan, putting him out for up to ten weeks. Freeman was a strong contender for MVP at the time, leading the league in home runs with 14 and second in on-base and slugging percentage. The 2018 Gold Glove for first base in the National League was won by Freeman and Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs. Ender Inciarte and Nick Markakis, Freeman’s teammates in center field and right field, earned the same award, marking the first time three Atlanta Braves had won the award in the same season.</p><p>In the second game of a doubleheader against the Washington Nationals, Freeman blasted his first career grand slam against pitcher Tanner Rainey. Two days later, against Nationals pitcher Kyle Finnegan, he blasted another grand slam. Baseball Digest’s MLB Player of the Year, Baseball America’s Player of the Year, MLBPA Player of the Year, and MLBPA Player of the Year NL Outstanding were all given to Freeman. Freeman won the National League Hank Aaron Award in 2020, becoming the franchise’s second player to do so after Andruw Jones in 2005.</p><h4>Social Media</h4><p>Freddie is active on various social media networks, including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. He has amassed a sizable following on Instagram, with 333K followers and 44 posts. Freddie primarily posts about his family and his game. He has 303K followers on Twitter. “Husband~Father~First baseman for the Atlanta Braves,” is his Twitter bio.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Freddie Freeman Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Frederick Charles Freeman</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>September 12, 1989</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>33 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Villa Park, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canadian-American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball First Baseman</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Freddie-Freeman-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 4” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 196 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 103 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 227 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>14 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Fred Freeman</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Rosemary Freeman</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Andrew Freeman</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>El Modena High School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>California State University</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Freddie-Freeman-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Wife</td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>Chelsea Freeman</a></td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Three (Maximus Turner, Brandon John & Frederick Charles Freeman II)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Freddie Freeman has been married to Chelsea Freeman for a long time.
