She grips champagne in one hand and a powder brush, which she softly dips into a blush palette that her makeup artist is holding for her, in the other. The multi-hyphenate star, who has been a muse for Andy Warhol and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/photography/interviews/a11666/jean-paul-goude-bazaar-icons-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jean-Paul Goude" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jean-Paul Goude</a>, is describing what Jamaica is like after it rains as she flawlessly applies her makeup without a mirror. When I ask her about her impressive makeup application, she replies, “It’s a feel of my face I’ve gained over the years. It’s not so much what I see, but more what I feel, because my face is not even whatsoever.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite Jones's iconic beauty looks, the 74-year-old has yet to ever make her mark in the space—until now. The singer, model, actress trifecta has teamed up with fine fragrance and candle brand <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/boy__smells/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Boy Smells" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Boy Smells</a> to create her very own candle, aptly called Grace. The scent features notes like black pepper, bergamot, salted musk, and wet stones accord (going back to Jamaica in the rain).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We catch up with Jones to get the scoop on her debut candle, life on tour, and her all-time favorite fragrance.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong><strong>What was the inspiration behind the scent?</strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When we spoke to Jérôme Epinette, who was developing the scent with Boy Smells, we had a wonderful conversation. He has traveled to Jamaica. He knew exactly what I would want in a scent. It's funny because he kind of provoked answers out of me, because, for me, making and developing a perfume is like an alien landing on Earth. I know smells from everyday life, but I had no idea all the different things that are involved in building a unique scent. It's quite a science and art form. You have to take elements and create something out of nowhere.</p><img alt="gace jones x boy smells" title="gace jones x boy smells" width=3648 height=4557 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-8651-jpg-1663093874.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Boy Smells</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What scents do you feel represent you the most?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Jérôme asked me that question, one scent that jumped out immediately was Jamaica after it rains. It's a smell that stays with you through your whole life–even after you've left. It's a specific smell to the island. Also, whatever is being cooked or grown on the island, because the foods there are very seasonal. He totally nailed it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I also mentioned my favorite perfumes that I couldn't get anymore. I went looking for Norman Norell’s fragrance. Nobody even knows Norman had a fragrance. He was a huge fashion designer, especially for Hollywood, and he had this amazing perfume. Once he passed away, you just couldn't find it. We couldn't truly re-create it with the candle. We bought three bottles on eBay, but they had all gone bad. But we read all about it, and we took inspiration. We pulled the elements I love: musk, leather, and Jamaica–and that informed everything. There was this one fruit from Jamaica that we explored, the naseberry, which very similar to a pear flavor.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Boy Smells Grace</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$31 at Boy Smells for Grace" data-href=https://boysmells.com/collections/candles/products/grace-candle-standard data-product-url=https://boysmells.com/collections/candles/products/grace-candle-standard data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fboysmells.com%2Fcollections%2Fcandles%2Fproducts%2Fgrace-candle-standard" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$31 at Boy Smells" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://boysmells.com/collections/candles/products/grace-candle-standard data-vars-ga-product-brand="Boy Smells" data-vars-ga-product-id=306cc3b7-5756-4c09-9252-2b9b3282dee9 data-vars-ga-product-price=$31.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1e4ab6e9-41d9-460a-a7bd-6370ee1a4bb4 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Boy Smells" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=grace-candle-standard data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt=Grace title=Grace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1663094257-UPDATE-GRACE_Candle-Standard_Grace1_V5-CROP_Shad1_1.png width=1860 height=2096 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Boy Smells Grace</h2></p><p>Now 40% Off</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong><strong>You have always been such an icon when it comes to mixing feminine and masculine style. How does it feel to be a pioneer of androgynous thinking?</strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's been around me my whole life because of my [brother] Chris, who passed away. I used to go to the gay bars with him all the time, and my mom would pick us up at the corner so my dad wouldn't know. She was a very cool mom. She just wanted us to get home safely. The LGBTQ+ community is so special, unique, and usually very gifted, because there is that heightened belief that one is not limited to the form that they were born in. They know that society tells them to behave, act, or feel a certain way. When you’re faced with giving up everything to be yourself, it’s very liberating.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>When did you feel the most liberated?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My grandfather was a politician. My granduncle was a bishop. We had this mix of politics and religion, which is very embedded in our society. To escape, my aunt had me come to her for a two-week holiday. She straightened my hair and drove me to the movies. Then, when I had to go back to the religious side, I would crinkle my hair back and not tell anyone that I went to the cinema. I was lucky to have that experience. It made me who I am today. She was a librarian, so she read all these books and gave me amazing information on how to raise my son.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong><strong>Since we're celebrating a candle today and I know you have two homes in Jamaica and one in London, plus, you’re on tour, what does your home smell like?</strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Okay, how do you know I have two homes?</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">I’m good at my research.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I guess so. Yes, we have a family home in Jamaica by the mountains. I inherited the land from my grandfather, but I haven't built on it yet. COVID slowed that down. He was given that land for volunteering in the World War and the house got destroyed by a hurricane or earthquake. It's amazing, beautiful land. Of course, it smells different in the mountains than it does down at the sea, you know. It's about what you grow there. The smell of mangoes is the biggest antidepressant. If you're depressed, smell a good Jamaican mango immediately; you'll have an, "Oh, my God" realization.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Was there anything she taught you that stuck with you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She taught me how to take the negative out of everything in my dialogue, which is very difficult. One of the hardest things to do is to not say "no," "don't," "never." I had to adapt to this mentality and switch it around when raising my son. I was like how do you get around saying "no"? If his hand is by a fire, how do I say, "Don't touch that"? Instead, I'd say, "If you do that, these are the consequences." It was an amazing lesson. There's a positive way to express yourself, even if it's harder.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’ve been a muse for so many artists. Who is your muse?</strong><strong><br></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They all are my muses. A muse goes both ways. You don't just sit there—it's a give and take. The key is to stick with the inspiration that brings you together and helps you work in a very creative way. When that happens, you're the muse and so is the amused.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong><strong>This is your first beauty collaboration. Why with Boy Smells, and why now? You’re such a trailblazer, so why did you wait to collaborate with a beauty brand?</strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’ve always felt like it was important to put my energy into music and performing. Boy Smells really was the perfect first venture, especially with the LGBTQ community involved, which is a very important part of the collaboration.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Does it feel different to be back on tour now?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Oh, my God, no. It's amazing. Even when COVID came and nobody was doing anything, I wrote some songs and still tried to stay positive. I couldn't wait to do some shows, which was great because I went out there and went fucking butt crazy. Also, a lot of my shows were very classic, but today's generation hasn't had the chance to experience that. I remember David Bowie said to me I don’t ever have to create a new show ever because all the classic ones, I like to call my limited editions, did not last long. That's why this is exciting, because I can now pull all of my previous shows together, and then add new elements, which will be a couple new tracks from the record that's coming. I just want to sing, talk, have fun, make jokes, shake, crawl, growl, roar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The limited-edition Grace candle is available to shop now for $46 online at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://boysmells.com/collections/candles/products/grace-candle-standard data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=boysmells.com data-vars-ga-product-id=b19c84e6-654f-4c04-9549-96c2f52a6423 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://boysmells.com/collections/candles/products/grace-candle-standard data-product-url=https://boysmells.com/collections/candles/products/grace-candle-standard data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fboysmells.com%2Fcollections%2Fcandles%2Fproducts%2Fgrace-candle-standard" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="Boy Smells" data-vars-ga-product-price=$31.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1e4ab6e9-41d9-460a-a7bd-6370ee1a4bb4 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Boy Smells" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">boysmells.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZppsYWaGdn2XbmagqpGYsm62zqecrGWSpMZuv8yeo6WrXZ67tbHRr6Cer18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./librem-14-review-secure-laptop.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Librem 14 Is the Most Secure Laptop You Can Buy, but It Comes at a High Price</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bonnie-bedelia-and-peter-riegert.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bonnie Bedelia and Peter Riegert</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-peacoats-women.html>15 Best Women's Peacoats of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-maradona-and-meat-5-facts-you-should-know-about-argentina.html>Messi, Maradona and meat: 5 facts you should know about Argentina - YP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-new-album-name-release-date-reveal.html>Selena Gomez's New Album Name &amp;amp; Release Date Reveal Is Just Too Good</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-lenny-on-good-bones-season-3.html>What Happened To Lenny On Good Bones Season 3?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gucci-bamboo-bag.html>Where to buy the Gucci Bamboo bag</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog.
